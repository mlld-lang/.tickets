# VFS test harness: exports not recognized in VFS mode

Two tests fail in the VFS test harness but pass on real filesystem:
- feat/executable-in-object-property
- feat/module-isolation-nested-import

Error: Import 'config' not found in module '/provider.mld'

The module is loaded (file exists), but the export statement isn't being processed correctly in VFS mode.

Regression introduced somewhere on envsec branch (works at merge-base with main).

To reproduce:
  npm run test:case -- feat/executable-in-object-property  # fails
  ./bin/mlld-wrapper.cjs tests/cases/feat/executable-in-object-property/example.mld  # passes
