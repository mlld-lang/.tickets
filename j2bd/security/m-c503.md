# Guard context scope: @mx.guard accessible outside guard evaluation

tests/cases/security/guard-context-scope-error: @mx.guard.try should error outside guard scope but doesn't. Guard context variables (try, name, etc.) should be scoped to guard evaluation only.


**2026-02-09 22:29 UTC:** Scoped @mx.guard to active guard/denied contexts only, enforced missing-field error for @mx.guard outside scope, updated guard-pre-hook expectations, and unskipped guard-context-scope-error fixture.
