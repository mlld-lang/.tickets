# @root error messages should include resolved path value

## Bug

When a file operation fails on an `@root`-based path (e.g., `load <@root/data/config.json>`), the error message shows the raw `@root` reference but not the resolved absolute path. Users cannot tell what `@root` resolved to, making debugging hard.

## Where to Look

`interpreter/env/ImportResolver.ts`:
- Line 184-188: `@root/` prefix is expanded to the project root path
- Line 272: `createFileNotFoundError()` generates `"File not found: ${inputPath}"`
- Line 280: suggestion text mentions `@root` but doesn't show its resolved value

## Fix

In `createFileNotFoundError()` at line 272 of `ImportResolver.ts`: when the original input path started with `@root`, append the resolved absolute path to the error message.

Before: `File not found: @root/data/config.json`
After: `File not found: @root/data/config.json (resolved to /Users/foo/project/data/config.json)`
