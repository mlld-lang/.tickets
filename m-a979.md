# Refresh docs/llm/ and llms.txt for accuracy

Refresh llms.txt and docs/llm/ generated files. Specific items: (1) llms.txt should be rebuilt to be howto intro content + module index table pointing to docs/llm/*.txt files. Currently manually maintained and drifting from the intro atom. Could be generated via a build script. (2) Verify docs/llm/ build scripts still work (docs/build/llm/*.mld -> docs/llm/llms-*.txt). (3) Verify llms-combined.txt regenerates cleanly via mlld run llmstxt. (4) Check if any atoms added since last build need inclusion in build scripts. (5) Check for deprecated syntax in generated output. llms-combined.txt is fully generated from atoms (via docs/llm/ intermediate files). llms.txt is the only manually maintained piece and should become generated too.
