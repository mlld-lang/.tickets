# Template alligator paths resolve from calling script, not template file

**Problem**

Alligator paths inside `.att` templates resolve relative to the calling `.mld` script, not the template file itself.

```
# workers/impl.att contains:
<../shared/workflow.md>

# Fails because ../ goes up from the script dir, not from workers/
```

**Expected behavior**

Paths in templates should resolve relative to the template file, similar to how imports work in most languages. This would let templates reference sibling directories naturally.

**Workaround**

Use `@base/` with full paths:
```
<@base/llm/run/j2bd/prompts/shared/workflow.md>
```

**Discovered during**

j2bd modular architecture spike - testing alligator includes inside .att templates.
