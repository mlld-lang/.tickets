# Investigate silent error swallowing patterns

Multiple .catch(() => {}) patterns found in production code that silently swallow errors. Files include: cli/commands/clean.ts:152-153, cli/mcp/MCPOrchestrator.ts:627, interpreter/env/Environment.ts:3112, interpreter/eval/import/DirectoryImportHandler.ts:78,88,95. Investigate each case — some may be legitimate (file cleanup), others may be hiding real errors.
