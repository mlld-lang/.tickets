# Duplicate error output is systematic across 6+ subsystems

## Current behavior

Error messages are printed twice across many subsystems, not just imports. Confirmed in: run-basics (cmd restrictions, js errors), templates-external (missing file), tool-reshaping (var tools validation), modules-importing-registry (not-found), security-getting-started.

## Expected behavior

Every error should be emitted exactly once.

## Fix

This is NOT isolated to one code path — it's a pattern in the error emission pipeline. Likely errors are emitted once by the evaluator and again by the CLI runner or error collector. Audit all error emission paths and add integration tests asserting error count === 1 for representative error types.

Note: m-5a05 covers the import-specific case. This ticket covers the systemic issue.
