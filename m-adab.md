# Implement defaults.rules two-step pattern demo

Create a focused implementation demo (impl/defaults-rules.mld) showing the two-step pattern: semantic labels + policy.operations + defaults.rules. Must demonstrate: (1) policy with all 4 rules, (2) semantic operation labels (net:w, fs:w), (3) operations classification, (4) secret blocked from exfil, (5) untrusted blocked from destructive, (6) normal data flows freely.
