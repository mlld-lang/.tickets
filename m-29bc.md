# Final review: defaults.rules two-step pattern

Holistic review of all changes for the defaults.rules job. Review diffs, check documentation accuracy, assess whether the implementation is solid.


**2026-02-09 11:42 UTC:** Final review: rating=solid, status=approved. Two-step pattern well-documented across all 5 atoms. Demo exercises all 4 rules. Consistent patterns and vocabulary. Minor issues: labels-sensitivity.md word count, policies.md parent metadata. None blocking.
