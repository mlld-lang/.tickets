# Design testing strategy for mlld orchestrators

The current mlld test system (variable-as-test, .test.mld files, assertion builtins) is shipped but light and hasn't been stress-tested recently. Before writing testing atoms, we need to design what testing should look like now. Considerations: (1) Hooks and guards could enable sophisticated testing patterns (mocking via guards, test isolation via environments, telemetry-based assertions). (2) Current test system is basic variable truthiness — is this enough for orchestrator testing? (3) What does LLM call mocking look like? Checkpoint-based replay? Guard-based interception? (4) Integration testing for multi-module orchestrators. (5) CI/CD patterns for non-deterministic LLM workflows. This is a design ticket, not an implementation ticket. Output: a clear testing vision that informs what atoms to write.
