# Multi-line imports don't parse

import { @a, @b } spread across multiple lines fails to parse. Must be a single line. The parser gives no error at the import itself — instead it reports a confusing error much later (e.g., 140 lines downstream at a loop directive). This is a paper cut when you have 10+ imports from one module.


**2026-02-12 12:50 UTC:** Validated and locked with regression coverage: added grammar test for multi-line selected import parsing in grammar/tests/import.test.ts. Verified parser accepts multi-line import lists and full npm test passes.
