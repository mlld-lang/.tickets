# Multi-line imports don't parse

import { @a, @b } spread across multiple lines fails to parse. Must be a single line. The parser gives no error at the import itself — instead it reports a confusing error much later (e.g., 140 lines downstream at a loop directive). This is a paper cut when you have 10+ imports from one module.
