# Object spread in var assignment drops security labels

var secret @orig = {k: "v"}; var @copy = { ...@orig } => @copy.mx.labels is [] instead of ["secret"]. Exe arg path ({ ...@creds }) preserves labels correctly, so bug is specific to var-assignment object-construction path. Repro: tmp/audit-spread-labels.mld


## Notes

**2026-02-24T13:44:34Z** Validated object-spread label propagation fixture and full suite; spread sources now preserve labels/taint in var assignment path.
