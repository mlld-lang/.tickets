# Template validation for mlld validate — detect undefined variable/function references in .att templates


**2026-02-18 07:38 UTC:** Context: llm/run/review-docs/prompts/workers/verify.att contained `@claude()` in backtick-wrapped text. Template interpolation tried to evaluate it as an executable invocation, producing a misleading 'Command not found: claude' error at runtime. The fix was escaping with \@, but this should be caught statically.

Proposal: extend `mlld validate` to support .att template files. When validating a template, resolve @variable and @function() references against the exe parameter list and any imports in scope. Flag references to undefined variables/functions as warnings or errors. This would catch typos, stale references, and accidental interpolation of literal @ mentions in prose.
