# Field access on missing fields should return null, add ? for optional

Field access behavior is inconsistent: `show @obj.missing` throws 'Field not found' error, but `for @x in [@obj] when @x.missing` silently fails. Proposal: (1) Field access on missing field should return null by default, (2) Add `@obj.field?` syntax for explicit optional access (consistent with `<path>?` for file loads). This makes the language more predictable and forgiving.
