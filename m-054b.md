# Code block source taint: js/sh/py/cmd should each add their own src: taint

Currently only cmd adds source taint (src:exec). The correct behavior:
- js blocks should add src:js
- sh blocks should add src:sh
- py blocks should add src:py
- cmd blocks should add src:cmd
- src:exec should mean pure mlld exe (no code block)

Current state tested with pii-labeled input through each block type:
- js:  labels preserved, taint: [pii] (missing src:js)
- sh:  labels preserved, taint: [pii] (missing src:sh)
- py:  labels preserved, taint: [pii] (missing src:py)
- cmd: labels preserved, taint: [pii, src:exec] (should be src:cmd not src:exec)

Label preservation (#2) works correctly. Source taint assignment (#1) is the gap.
No fixture tests exist for any of this.
