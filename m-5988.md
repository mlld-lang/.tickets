# Adversarial verification: security feature exit criteria


**2026-02-04 21:55 UTC:** ## Purpose

Run adversarial verification to PROVE all exit criteria hold for the security feature documentation job.

## Exit Criteria to Verify

From the success criteria:

### Phase 1: Documentation
- [ ] signing-overview atom exists with working code example
- [ ] sign-verify atom exists with working code example  
- [ ] autosign-autoverify atom exists with working code example
- [ ] labels-influenced atom exists with working code example
- [ ] pattern-audit-guard atom exists with working code example

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Signed audit template that can be verified
- [ ] First agent processes untrusted data (outputs get influenced label)
- [ ] Auditor verifies its own instructions before trusting them
- [ ] Guard blocks action if audit fails or verification fails
- [ ] End-to-end flow: untrusted input → influenced output → audit → action/rejection

### Phase 3: Verification
- [ ] Run target example code end-to-end
- [ ] Verify influenced label is applied to LLM outputs
- [ ] Verify sign and verify directives work
- [ ] Verify autoverify policy triggers verification automatically
- [ ] Test injection attack is detected (tampered instructions don't verify)

## Verification Mechanisms

1. Run mlld validate on all atom code examples
2. Run mlld on the implementation file and check output
3. Run relevant unit tests: npm test -- --testPathPattern=sign-verify|autoverify|builtin-rules
4. Attempt adversarial scenarios:
   - Try to bypass verification
   - Try to modify signed template after signing
   - Verify influenced label propagates correctly
