# VariableRedefinition error points to wrong line

When a variable name conflict occurs between a module-level var and an imported function's parameter name, the error message points to the wrong line. Example: var @run defined at line 44, imported @saveRunState(runDir, run) called at line 47 — error says 'Variable run redefined at line 46' which is actually 'let @newState = ...' (a completely different variable). The error should point to the actual conflict location — either the function call site or the parameter definition in the imported module. This made the m-e084 bug very hard to diagnose.
