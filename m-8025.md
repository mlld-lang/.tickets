# processMlld lazy-loaded chunks fail when imported from external scripts

When processMlld is loaded via dynamic import('../dist/index.mjs') from an external Node script (e.g., doc-expect.mjs), certain lazily-loaded evaluators (data-value-evaluator, for-evaluator, etc.) fail with 'Cannot find module' errors referencing stale chunk hashes. The same code works fine via the mlld CLI. Affects programmatic SDK usage. Likely a tsup code-splitting issue where lazy import() calls inside the bundle don't resolve correctly when loaded from an external script context.
