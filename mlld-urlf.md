# Docs Phase 3: Cookbook modernization

Update llms-cookbook.txt with modern patterns and richer examples.

## Focus Areas
1. Are current recipes still the best patterns?
2. What new patterns should be added?
3. Do examples use latest syntax?
4. Are there common real-world patterns missing?

## Approach
- Review each recipe against current best practices
- Update syntax to latest conventions
- Add new recipes for capabilities added since original writing
- Ensure examples are production-quality

## Depends On
Phase 1 audit to know what's new
Phase 2 strategy to know priorities
