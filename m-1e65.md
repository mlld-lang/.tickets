# Add cmd/sh/js/py variable syntax comparison table to intro

## What's missing

`docs/src/atoms/intro.md` has one line about native variable syntax in language blocks but no comparison table. This is the #1 onboarding confusion from QA.

## Add this table

| Block | mlld vars | Native vars | Comments |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| cmd | `@name` | n/a | mlld interpolation |
| sh | not available | \$name | exe params become shell vars |
| js | not available | `paramName` | exe params are JS locals |
| py | not available | `paramName` | exe params are Python locals |

Place it near the existing line about native variable syntax. Keep it brief — this is for token efficiency in the intro.
