# Fix doc: policy denials ARE catchable by denied handlers

mcp-policy.md line 58 claims policy denials 'cannot be caught with denied => handlers' but guard-denial-handler.ts:31-39 explicitly routes POLICY_LABEL_FLOW_DENIED to denied handlers. Adversarial test adv-05 proved it. Fix: update the sentence to accurately describe behavior while preserving security messaging.
