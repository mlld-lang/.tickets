# Verify env config auth field behavior for local (providerless) execution

The env config's auth field is consumed by resolveEnvironmentAuthSecrets() in executeProviderCommand() — meaning it flows secrets to providers. For local (providerless) execution, it's unclear whether auth in the env config does anything, or whether only 'using auth:*' on the run command matters. Need to verify: (1) does env config auth affect local execution? (2) if not, update env-directive.md 'Local execution with different auth' example to remove auth from config object, since only 'using auth:*' on run cmd would be doing the work.

## Acceptance Criteria

Confirmed behavior documented. env-directive.md example is accurate.


**2026-02-16 06:55 UTC:** Investigated: env config auth field DOES affect local (providerless) execution. In run-command-executor.ts:387-459, resolveEnvironmentAuthSecrets() is called for the scoped env config and injected into the command's env vars regardless of provider presence. Same pattern confirmed in command-handler.ts, run-exec-definition-dispatcher.ts, and pipeline execute-command.ts. The env-directive.md example is accurate. The auth in env config applies to all commands in the block; 'using auth:*' applies per-command; they're additive. No doc fix needed. Closing.
