# Move system built-ins to @mx.* namespace

System built-ins currently occupy the global namespace and collide with user variable names (@exists, @upper, @debug, etc). Move them under @mx.*:

- @mx.now — current timestamp (currently @now)
- @mx.parse — parse string to structured data (currently @json)
- @mx.parse.llm — extract JSON from messy LLM output (currently @json.llm)
- @mx.parse.strict / @mx.parse.loose — JSON5 variants (currently @json.strict/@json.loose)
- Audit all other reserved names and move to @mx.*

Rationale:
- .mx already means 'system-provided' on values (@file.mx.filename)
- @mx.* for globals creates a single mental model: 'mx is system stuff'
- Frees global namespace for users — no more surprise collisions
- 3 chars of verbosity is negligible vs debugging mystery 'already defined' errors

Deprecation: old names continue working but mlld validate warns. Eventually remove.
