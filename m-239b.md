# ## Bug

`output @content to \`@dir/@name\`` treats the backtick path as a literal string instead of interpolating it. The file gets written to a literal path named \`@dir/@name\` in the script directory.

### Expected
Backtick template paths in `output ... to` should interpolate variables the same way they do everywhere else in the language.

### Actual
The backtick expression is used as-is as the filename. No error, no warning — silent wrong behavior.

### Workaround
Use a quoted string with a variable: `output @content to "@path"` where `@path` is a `let` holding the interpolated value. Or use `sh { cp }`.

### Reproduction
```mlld
var @dir = "/tmp"
var @name = "test.txt"
output "hello" to \`@dir/@name\`
>> Creates a literal file named \`@dir/@name\` instead of /tmp/test.txt
```

### Found in
review-docs orchestrator Phase 4 write-back. All 14 revisions were silently written to a single literal file \`@root/@entry.target\` in the script directory.
