# Alligator section selectors should work as exe body

## Current behavior

`exe @releaseNotes(version) = <CHANGELOG.md # "[@version]">` fails with 'Invalid exe syntax'. Alligator file-load expressions with section selectors are not recognized as valid exe bodies by the grammar.

## Expected behavior

All alligator expressions should be valid exe bodies, including:
- Section selection: `exe @fn(v) = <file.md # "[@v]">`
- Include/exclude sets: `exe @fn(topic) = <docs/*.md # @topic; !# Internal>`
- Negation: `exe @fn() = <file.md; !# Changelog>`
- Optional selectors: `exe @fn(s) = <file.md # "@s"?>`

## Fix

Update the grammar to accept alligator expressions (with section selectors) as exe bodies. The alligator expression already parses correctly in other contexts (var, show, etc.) — it just needs to be added to the exe body alternatives.

## Docs

docs/src/atoms/intro.md already shows this pattern. After fixing, verify the intro example works:
```mlld
exe @releaseNotes(version) = <CHANGELOG.md # "[@version]">
```
