# Move modules+registry explainer into reference docs

The modules-and-registry.md explainer is a merge of docs/user/modules.md and docs/user/registry.md. It should eventually move into the reference section, with missing content assessed against what the atoms provide. The atom-based modules page covers creating/importing/exporting but the explainer has richer content on registry publishing, lock files, version management, and the full publishing workflow.
