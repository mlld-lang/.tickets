# Guard exe dependencies should resolve in defining module scope

When a guard defined in a module calls a helper exe from the same module, that exe must be separately exported and imported by the consumer. The guard's internal dependencies should resolve in the module where it was defined, not require the importer to know about them.

## Acceptance Criteria

A guard that calls a helper exe defined in the same module works when imported, without the importer needing to also import the helper exe.
