# Module imports should be idempotent — double import causes guard re-registration error

Importing the same module twice (e.g., once for a named guard import and once for a policy import) throws 'Guard with name X already exists'. Module evaluation should be cached so that re-importing the same module reuses the previous evaluation result rather than re-executing side effects like guard registration.

## Acceptance Criteria

import { @guard } from './m.mld' followed by import policy @p from './m.mld' works without error when the module defines both a guard and a policy config.
