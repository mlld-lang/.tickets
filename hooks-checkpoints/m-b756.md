# Data-label hooks match at operation level, not per-variable

## Problem

The spec implies per-variable granularity ("when data receives the label") but implementation matches at operation level only. The guard system has per-input candidates as a contrast.

## Evidence

- user-hook-runner.ts:159-165 iterates operation.labels to find matching data hooks
- No per-variable label resolution — hooks fire for the entire operation, not individual labeled variables within it

## Impact

Low — current behavior is reasonable and consistent with how operation contexts work. May want to either update the spec to match or add per-variable resolution in the future.
