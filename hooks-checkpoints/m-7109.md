# Validate operation type identifiers in hook filters

## Problem

hook after op:totallyinvalid:nonsense parses without error and silently never fires. No known-types validation exists for the op: filter in hook declarations.

## Options

1. Warn at parse time when op: type is not in the known set (exe, var, for, for:iteration, for:batch, loop, import, show, output, append, run)
2. Warn at registration time in HookRegistry
3. Accept and document that unknown op types are valid (forward-compatible) but add a linter warning
