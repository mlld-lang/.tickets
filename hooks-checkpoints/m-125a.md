# Update spec document in single pass — stale references

## Problem

Multiple spec sections contradict the implementation after development:
- registerBuiltinHooks code sample shows wrong pre-hook order (guard before checkpoint; code does checkpoint before guard)
- Appendix C line numbers are off by 40-100 lines across multiple files
- Checkpoint-pre-hook pseudocode uses legacy continue action; implementation uses fulfill
- Contract and risk-gates docs present as pre-implementation when all features are shipped

## Work

Single-pass update of spec-hooks-checkpoints-resume.md to align pseudocode, line references, and action names with the actual implementation.
