# Remove or implement documented exit codes 2-5

## Problem

docs/user/cli.md documents exit codes 2-5 with specific meanings, but these are not implemented in the CLI code. The CLI only uses exit code 0 (success) and 1 (error).

## Options

1. Implement the documented exit codes in the CLI
2. Remove undocumented exit codes from docs
