# Remove or implement documented exit codes 2-5

## Problem

`docs/user/cli.md:1002-1009` documents exit codes 2-5:

```
- `0` - Success
- `1` - General error
- `2` - Invalid arguments
- `3` - File not found
- `4` - Authentication required
- `5` - Network error
```

The entire CLI codebase only ever calls `process.exit(0)` or `process.exit(1)`. Exit codes 2-5 are fictional — they were never implemented.

## Required change

Remove exit codes 2-5 from `docs/user/cli.md`. Keep only:

```
- `0` - Success
- `1` - Error
```

Also check and update the same exit codes section if it appears in:
- `docs/llm/llms-cli.txt`
- `docs/src/` (website source atoms)
- `spec-hooks-checkpoints-resume.md`

## Acceptance criteria

- `docs/user/cli.md` exit codes section lists only 0 and 1.
- No other docs file references exit codes 2-5.
