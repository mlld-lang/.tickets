# Anchor checkpoint cache path to project root

## Problem

CheckpointManager resolves cache paths relative to cwd, but the run command uses findProjectRoot() for script resolution. Running mlld from a subdirectory creates orphaned caches in .mlld/checkpoints/ under the subdirectory instead of the project root.

## Fix

Pass findProjectRoot() result to CheckpointManager so cache paths are always anchored to the project root regardless of cwd.
