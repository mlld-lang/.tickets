# Add test for --resume implies --checkpoint

## Problem

shouldEnableCheckpoint() correctly handles --resume implying --checkpoint, but no test verifies this behavior. It could regress undetected.

## Work

Add a test that runs with --resume (no explicit --checkpoint) and verifies checkpoint caching is active.
