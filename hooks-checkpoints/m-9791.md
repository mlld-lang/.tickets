# Phase 2.5: Lifecycle characterization baseline

Implement Phase 2.5 lifecycle characterization baseline.

Scope:
- Add characterization tests that pin current lifecycle ordering before Phase 3 edits:
  - directive boundary ordering
  - exec boundary ordering
  - guard suppression baseline in nested guard-evaluated paths
- Assertions should record explicit event sequence, not only final pass/fail.

## Design

Create dedicated characterization suite:
- `tests/interpreter/hooks/lifecycle-characterization.test.ts`
Use lightweight event logging probes around existing hook/guard lifecycle points.

## Acceptance Criteria

Exit criteria:
- Added test coverage:
  - `tests/interpreter/hooks/lifecycle-characterization.test.ts`
- All tests pass:
  - `npm test tests/interpreter/hooks/lifecycle-characterization.test.ts`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm test`
- Docs updates complete:
  - `docs/dev/HOOKS.md` references characterization baseline
- Commit made after green tests:
  - `test(hooks): add lifecycle characterization baseline before hook lifecycle refactor`
