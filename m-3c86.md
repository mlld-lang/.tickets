# Ruby SDK

Add a Ruby SDK wrapper for mlld, following the same pattern as the Go, Python, and Rust SDKs. Thin CLI wrapper providing process(), execute(), and analyze() methods with idiomatic Ruby API.

## Design

Files: sdk/ruby/lib/mlld.rb (~200-250 LOC), sdk/ruby/mlld.gemspec, sdk/ruby/README.md. Uses stdlib Open3.capture3 for subprocess calls and JSON for parsing — no external gem dependencies. Client class with process, execute, analyze. Result types via Struct or Data (Ruby 3.2+). Module-level convenience methods. Error class inheriting StandardError. Same CLI flags as other SDKs: /dev/stdin for process, --structured + --inject for execute, analyze --format json for analyze.

## Acceptance Criteria

- sdk/ruby/ directory with lib/mlld.rb, mlld.gemspec, README.md
- Mlld::Client class with process, execute, analyze methods
- Typed result structs: ExecuteResult, AnalyzeResult, StateWrite, Effect, Metrics, etc.
- Mlld::Error exception class
- Module-level convenience methods (Mlld.process, Mlld.execute, Mlld.analyze)
- No external gem dependencies (stdlib open3 + json only)
- README follows same structure as Go/Python/Rust READMEs
- sdk/README.md updated to include Ruby
