# Fix docs: @obj with {} is config syntax, not object modifier

## What's wrong

`docs/src/atoms/security/env-overview.md` and `docs/src/atoms/security/env-blocks.md` show examples like:

```mlld
var @readonly = @cfg with { tools: ["Read"] }
```

This implies `with {}` creates a derived object with overrides — like JS spread. It does not. `with {}` is **env directive config syntax** that only works in the `env` directive context:

```mlld
env @cfg with { tools: ["Read"] } [
  ...
]
```

## Fix

Remove or rewrite any `var @x = @y with { ... }` examples in env-overview.md and env-blocks.md. Only show `with {}` in `env` directive context where it actually works. If a "derive object with overrides" example is needed, show the spread alternative: `var @readonly = { ...@cfg, tools: ["Read"] }`.
