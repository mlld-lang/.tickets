# let should allow re-declaration in the same block scope

## Current behavior

```mlld
exe @example() = [
  let @x = 1
  let @x = 2    >> ERROR: Variable 'x' is already defined and cannot be redefined
]
```

`let` is documented as block-scoped and mutable, but re-declaring `let @x` in the same block throws a variable-redefinition error.

## Expected behavior

`let @x = ...` followed by `let @x = ...` in the same block should work as reassignment. This is how `let` works in JavaScript and is the natural expectation for a mutable binding.

## Impact

Forces awkward workarounds with unique variable names when you want to refine a value through multiple steps (e.g. filter then re-filter, parse then validate).
