# mcpConfig.config field is accepted but never used

## Problem

MCPOrchestrator accepts `config?: Record<string, unknown>` in McpServerConfig (line 29), preserves it when normalizing (lines 721-724), includes it in serverInfos (line 468), but never passes it to the spawned MCP server.

The config is effectively dead code.

## Options

1. **Remove the field** - If there's no use case, remove it from the interface and normalization
2. **Implement it** - Pass config to MCP server initialization or as env vars

## Recommendation

Remove unless there's a specific use case. The MCP protocol's initialize message doesn't have a standard config field, so this would need custom handling.
