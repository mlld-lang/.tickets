# Add 'See Also' cross-references to all howto pages

## What to do

Add a `## See Also` section at the bottom of each howto page in `docs/src/atoms/howto/` that links to related pages. The goal is discoverability — features documented on one page should be findable from related pages.

Known missing cross-references (not exhaustive — check all pages):
- `escaping-basics` → link to `@@` double-at escaping
- `file-loading-basics` → link to `file-loading-metadata`
- `exe-simple` → link to sh block examples (or add them)
- `output` → link to or mention format specifiers (`as json`, `as yaml`, `as text`)
- `log` → link to pipeline effects (`| log`)
- `variables-basics` → link to `variables-conditional`

Format: a simple bulleted list of `[Page Title](relative-link)` with one-line descriptions of what's covered there.
