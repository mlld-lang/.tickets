# Refine severity definitions in issue-schemas.md

Update severity table: major = 'Feature doesn't work as documented AND no workaround after 3+ approaches. Must point to specific doc statement that's contradicted.' minor = 'Feature works but docs could be clearer, or workaround was non-obvious but found.'


**2026-02-15 22:52 UTC:** Refined severity definitions in issue-schemas.md: major requires doc contradiction + no workaround; minor for doc clarity or non-obvious workarounds. Addresses 60% severity inflation rate.
