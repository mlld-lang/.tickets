# Binary expressions not allowed as exe function arguments

Calling an exe function with a binary expression as an argument fails to parse.

## Reproduction

```mlld
exe @floor(n) = js { return Math.floor(n); }
var @score = 0.85
var @tagLevel = @floor(@score * 10)  // Parse error
```

Error: `Text content not allowed in strict mode (.mld)` at the expression inside the parentheses.

## Workaround

Compute the expression in a separate let statement first:

```mlld
let @scaled = @score * 10
let @tagLevel = @floor(@scaled)  // Works
```

## Expected

Binary expressions like `@score * 10`, `@a + @b`, etc. should be valid as exe function arguments.


**2026-01-30 12:37 UTC:** Verified still broken. @floor(@score * 10) produces 'Text content not allowed in strict mode' parse error.

**2026-01-31 07:56 UTC:** Bug has been fixed. Binary expressions like @floor(@score * 10) now parse and execute correctly. Test case exists at tests/cases/feat/expression-args-arrays/ and passes. Verified working with multiplication, addition, and compound expressions.
