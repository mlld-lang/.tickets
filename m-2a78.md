# Resolve or remove 50+ TODO/FIXME comments before release

50+ unresolved TODO/FIXME comments throughout the codebase. Key examples: PublishCommand.ts "TODO: Implement registry resolution logic" and "TODO: Implement rollback logic", ErrorHandler.ts "TODO: Add --verbose flag support", cli/index.ts "TODO: debugContextCommand is not imported", core/errors/index.ts "TODO: Consolidate ErrorCode usage", EmbeddedLanguageService.ts TODO for WASM builds. Each should be resolved, converted to a tracked ticket, or removed.
