# Final holistic review of all code changes, documentation, and artifacts for the dual-audit airlock security job. Review quality, accuracy, and whether documentation promises match implementation reality.


**2026-02-09 14:18 UTC:** Final review complete. Rating: solid. Status: approved. One moderate finding: guard syntax mismatch between demo (for llm) and docs (after llm). Unable to fix due to write permissions being declined. All other findings were minor/observations. Cross-references accurate, syntax valid, implementation backs documented claims.
