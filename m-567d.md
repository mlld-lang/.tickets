# Enhance policy-capabilities.md with danger double-gate

Add 'How allow and danger interact' section explaining: (1) allow is general whitelist, (2) danger is separate opt-in gate, (3) both must pass. Example showing operation that matches allow but blocked by danger. Gap 11.


**2026-02-15 20:55 UTC:** Enhanced policy-capabilities.md with 'How allow and danger interact' section. Explains double-gate semantics with working examples. Verified against core/policy/guards.ts and filesystem-policy.ts. Addresses Gap 11.
