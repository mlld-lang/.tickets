# Audit and fix MCP import examples using fake short-name server specs

The mcp-import atom and other MCP docs use short-name server specs like '"@anthropic/filesystem"' and '"@github/issues"' that don't actually resolve to anything. mlld needs a launchable command string as the server spec (e.g., '"npx @anthropic/mcp-server-filesystem /workspace"'). The short-name form is aspirational — mlld has no built-in registry mapping package names to launch commands. All MCP import examples need to be audited and fixed to use real, working command strings. Files to audit: docs/src/atoms/commands/mcp-import.md, docs/src/atoms/commands/mcp.md, and any other atoms referencing 'from mcp' with short names.

also the examples need to be tested -- this says it is importing echo from this??? seems hallucinated as well.
