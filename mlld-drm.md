# Comment highlighting inconsistent across files

Some >> comments are highlighted (lines 15, 20, 22) but others aren't (lines 6, 10). All should be consistently highlighted. May be related to comment position or parsing context.

## Notes

Comment highlighting is consistent - verified with 100% coverage on test cases
