# Docs Phase 2: Structure and strategy

Define the strategic structure for mlld documentation.

## Questions to Answer
1. Who are our audiences? (new users, LLM agents, power users, contributors)
2. What's the learning journey for each?
3. What structure best serves each audience?
4. What examples are canonical vs edge-case?

## Deliverable
- Doc structure proposal (what docs exist, in what order, what each covers)
- Priority ranking for updates
- Style guide updates if needed

## Inputs
- Phase 1 audit findings
- Current doc structure analysis
- User feedback if available
