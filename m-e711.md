# Add 'mlld differs from JS' summary to intro for LLM token efficiency

## What's needed

`docs/src/atoms/intro.md` needs a concise section listing the key ways mlld differs from JavaScript. This is the single highest-impact doc addition for reducing LLM agent confusion — QA found JS assumption transfer was the #1 source of wrong mental models.

## Content to add

A brief section (not a full gotchas page — that exists separately) covering:
1. Template syntax: use `@var`, not \${var}. Writing \${@var} renders \${} as literal text.
2. No `undefined` literal — use `null` and `@exists()`
3. Truthiness: `[]`, `{}`, `"0"`, `"false"` are falsy (truthy in JS)
4. Variable access in language blocks: only `cmd` uses `@var`. sh/js/py use native syntax.
5. `<@var>` triggers file loading, not text output — use `@var` directly for text.

Keep it to ~10 lines. This goes in the intro specifically because the intro is what LLM agents read first — catching these assumptions early prevents downstream confusion.
