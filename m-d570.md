# Make py and python interchangeable in grammar

py only works in statement position (e.g. run py { ... }) but fails in assignment position (var @x = py { ... }). python works in both. Extend the grammar so py works everywhere python does. Check grammar/patterns/ for where python and py are defined as run subtypes, and ensure py is accepted in all the same positions as python.

## Acceptance criteria
- var @x = py { print(42) } works (currently parse error)
- exe @fn() = py { print(42) } works (currently parse error)  
- run py { print(42) } continues to work
- All positions where python works, py also works
- Add test cases for py in assignment position in tests/cases/
