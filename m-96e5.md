# Fix misleading doc: exe-simple.md claims Python params arrive as strings

## What's wrong

In `docs/src/atoms/commands/exe-simple.md`, the docs claim Python parameters arrive as strings. They don't — mlld passes typed values (int, float, bool, etc.) to Python exe blocks.

## Fix

Find the claim about Python params being strings in exe-simple.md and correct it to say parameters arrive with their original types (numbers as int/float, booleans as bool, strings as str, etc.).
