# doc: fix script-return misleading phrasing about if/when branches

## Problem

script-return.md opens with: '=> @value terminates script execution immediately and returns a value. Top-level if and when branches can return through the script context.'

The second sentence is vague — it sounds like any if/when magically returns from the script. What it actually means: => inside a top-level if or when block terminates the entire script.

## Fix

Rewrite the opening to be unambiguous. Something like:
'=> @value terminates script execution immediately. When => appears inside a top-level if or when block, it terminates the script (not just the block).'
