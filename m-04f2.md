# Add 'mlld is not JavaScript' section to gotchas

## What to add

Add an **"mlld is not JavaScript"** section to the gotchas howto page (`docs/src/atoms/howto/gotchas.md` or equivalent). This was the #1 source of friction in QA testing.

Cover these specific differences:

1. **Template syntax**: mlld uses `@var` for interpolation, not `${var}`. Writing `${@var}` renders the `${}` as literal text.
2. **No `undefined` literal**: mlld has `null` but no `undefined`. Using `undefined` in code gives a parse error.
3. **Truthiness**: `[]` and `{}` are falsy in mlld (truthy in JS). See m-fbec for the full table.
4. **Variable interpolation in shell blocks**: `@var` does NOT interpolate in `sh {}` blocks. Use native shell syntax `$varname` instead. (mlld exe params are auto-available as shell vars.)
5. **Equality coercion**: `"5" == 5` is true (like JS), but `true == 1` is false (unlike JS). No boolean-to-number coercion.
