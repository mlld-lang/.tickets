# Support method calls on array literals

Array literals like `[...].flat()` or `[...].join(',')` currently fail to parse — the grammar only supports method calls on variable references (`@var.flat()`). The workaround is assigning to a variable first. Grammar should be extended to allow `ArrayLiteral` as a valid target for `PostFieldAccess` / `MethodCallAccess`.
