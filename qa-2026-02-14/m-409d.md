# Docs: variables-conditional clarify ?? spacing

QA was wrong about ?? being limited to string literals. `@a ?? @b` (with spaces) works for variable-to-variable fallback. The tight form `@var??"default"` is template-only.

Doc should clarify:
- In expression contexts (var assignments etc), use spaces: `@a ?? @b`
- In templates, tight form works: `@var??"default"`
- Chaining works: `@a ?? @b ?? "fallback"`

QA topic: variables-conditional

## Acceptance Criteria

Doc shows both tight (template) and spaced (expression) forms with examples

**2026-02-15 10:49 UTC:** Clarified nullish fallback docs to separate tight template form (@var??"default") from spaced expression form (@a ?? @b), added chained expression fallback example, and synced generated docs fixture metadata for content-and-data line shifts. Validation: npm test -- tests/cases/docs/content-and-data/ (suite passed: 385 files, 4166 tests). Commit: 385a92ad3.
