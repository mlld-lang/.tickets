# Remove xml, csv, md, lower, upper from built-in transformer docs

These transformers are moving to userland modules (won't remove from core due to test deps, but shouldn't document). Remove from pipelines-basics built-in list. Keep @parse, @trim, @pretty, @sort.

Also: @json is deprecated alias of @parse - don't document.

## Acceptance Criteria

Docs list only: @parse, @trim, @pretty, @sort as built-in transformers


**2026-02-15 15:51 UTC:** Removed xml, csv, md, lower, upper from pipelines-basics.md built-in transformer list. Kept @parse, @trim, @pretty, @sort. Removed @upper/@lower/@csv usage from code examples. @json not documented (deprecated alias).
