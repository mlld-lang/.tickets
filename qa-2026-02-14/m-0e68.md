# console.log in js{} pipeline transformers replaces return value with stdout

stdout from console.log inside js{} pipeline transformers becomes the value passed to the next stage instead of the function's return value.

QA topic: pipelines-basics

## Acceptance Criteria

js{} pipeline transformer return values are not affected by console.log output


**2026-02-15 09:21 UTC:** Fixed multiline implicit-return handling for js/node code blocks so trailing expressions are returned when earlier statements include console.log, while preserving single-statement run behavior. Added regression coverage in implicit-return executor tests plus an end-to-end pipeline data-handling case. Verified with full npm test (4149 passed, 60 skipped).
