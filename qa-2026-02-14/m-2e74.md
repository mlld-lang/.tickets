# op:show guards corrupt output to JSON structure

Show guards cause show to emit JSON structure instead of string value.

QA topic: security-before-guards

## Acceptance Criteria

show with guards outputs the string value, not JSON structure


**2026-02-15 08:56 UTC:** Added regression coverage for before op:show guard transforms to assert show output remains plain text and does not leak internal guard Variable JSON structure. Verified with npm test run (all passing).
