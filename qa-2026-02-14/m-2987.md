# Code cleanup: m-1926 guard unwrapping is a band-aid

The unwrapGuardTransformValue unbounded loop in guard-transform.ts fixes symptom not root cause. Should investigate why materializeGuardTransform receives Variable-wrapped values and fix upstream caller.

Current: while(isVariable) loop with cycle detection
Better: fix the caller to not double-wrap

## Acceptance Criteria

Guard transforms receive unwrapped values, unbounded loop removed
