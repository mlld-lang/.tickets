# Docs: modules-structure - import syntax confusion, path resolution undocumented

Directory namespace imports vs file selective imports not distinguished. Path resolution rules (relative to script, not cwd) undocumented. Frontmatter vs module.yml tradeoffs unexplained.

QA topic: modules-structure

## Acceptance Criteria

Doc distinguishes import styles, documents path resolution and metadata precedence
