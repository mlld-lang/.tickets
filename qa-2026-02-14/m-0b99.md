# Code cleanup: m-e722 dead interface members and missing import

execution-evaluator.ts has dead interpolateWithSecurity in interface (line 25-28), still passed by caller in var.ts:135. Also missing InterpolationContext import. TypeScript resolves via inference but file not self-contained.

Also: wrap-unwrap-reparse path (evaluateRun -> asText -> processCommandOutput) risks data loss.

## Acceptance Criteria

Dead interface member removed, import added or type declared locally
