# Docs: when-inline clarify it's for single expressions

When inline is just for single expressions: `when @condition => @value`. Same semantics as block form, just shorthand. Doc should show what inline form looks like vs when to use block form.

QA topic: when-inline

## Acceptance Criteria

Doc shows inline form as single-expression shorthand with clear example

**2026-02-15 10:43 UTC:** Clarified when-inline docs as single-expression shorthand, documented equivalence to first-match when-list semantics, and added block/list guidance for multi-branch or multi-statement use. Updated user flow-control docs and regenerated docs fixture descriptions. Validation: npm test -- tests/cases/docs/flow-control/ (suite passed: 385 files, 4166 tests). Commit: b10d32578.
