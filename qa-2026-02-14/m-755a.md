# Clarify label-modification docs: trusted!/!label/clear! only works in privileged guards

Current doc (line 65) says 'privilege only flows through guard evaluation context' but doesn't explicitly state the shorthand syntax ONLY works in privileged guards.

Make clearer:
1. Show example of privileged guard using the shorthand
2. Explicitly state it doesn't work in exe blocks, when blocks, or non-privileged guards
3. Current text is technically accurate but requires too much inference

## Acceptance Criteria

Doc explicitly shows where trusted!/!label/clear! works with example
