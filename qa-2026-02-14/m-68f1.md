# Docs: pipelines-basics missing built-in transformers, array semantics, error handling

Built-in transformers (@trim, @upper, @lower, @pretty, @sort) only in reserved-variables, not pipelines-basics. Doesn't clarify transformers receive whole value (not auto-mapped over arrays). No error handling docs.

QA topic: pipelines-basics

## Acceptance Criteria

Doc lists built-in transformers, clarifies whole-value semantics, covers error handling
