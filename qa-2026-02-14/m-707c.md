# Docs: tool-call-tracking clarify @mx.tools context

@mx.tools provides guard context for tool call information (spec Section 1.9):
- @mx.tools.calls - array of tool calls made this turn
- @mx.tools.allowed - tools the LLM is permitted to use
- @mx.tools.denied - tools explicitly denied

QA tester completely misunderstood this as tracking outbound MCP calls. The doc needs to clearly show the context in which @mx.tools is used (guard expressions checking tool call patterns).

QA topic: tool-call-tracking

## Acceptance Criteria

Doc shows @mx.tools used in guard context with clear example of what the fields contain

**2026-02-15 09:58 UTC:** Rewrote tool-call-tracking docs to frame @mx.tools as guard-context metadata (calls/allowed/denied) with explicit guard examples and scope notes; removed ambiguous non-guard framing. Added rc82 changelog note and verified via full npm test (4157 passed, 60 skipped).
