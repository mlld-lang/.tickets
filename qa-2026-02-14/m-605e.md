# Docs: escaping-at presents @@ and \@ as equivalent (they're not)

@@ is context-dependent (templates only), \@ is universal. Docs should lead with \@ as the recommended approach and explain when @@ does and doesn't work.

QA topic: escaping-at

## Acceptance Criteria

Doc recommends \@ as primary, explains @@ is template-context only


**2026-02-15 09:57 UTC:** Updated escaping-at docs to recommend \@ as the primary escape, and clarified that @@ is template-context-only shorthand. Added rc82 changelog entry and verified with full npm test (4157 passed, 60 skipped).
