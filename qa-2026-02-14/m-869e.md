# @p[-1] returns current input instead of previous stage output

@p[-1] (previous stage access) returns the current input, identical to @input, instead of the previous stage's output.

QA topic: pipelines-basics

## Acceptance Criteria

@p[-1] returns the output of the previous pipeline stage


**2026-02-15 09:52 UTC:** Investigated @p[-1] report in pipeline contexts, added regression coverage for cmd-source + when-branch access, and clarified docs that @p[-1] is previous-stage output (same value as current stage input). Full npm test passed (4155 passed, 60 skipped).
