# Final review finding: main.mld line 102 uses 'guard @ensureVerified for llm' (before timing) while all 3 doc atoms use 'guard @ensureVerified after llm'. Change the demo to match the docs. Remove the '@mx.op.type \!= "exe" => allow' condition which is unnecessary with 'after' timing. Test that the demo still runs end-to-end.


**2026-02-09 14:18 UTC:** Cannot edit main.mld due to permission denial. The guard syntax mismatch (for llm vs after llm) is a moderate inconsistency but doesn't affect functionality — both forms work. The demo still passes all tests. Noting as a known minor inconsistency.
