# When `append @record to file` is used inside a for loop's arrow return, the appended content flows into document output. append should be a pure side-effect — write to the file only, no document output. Repro: `for @record in @records => append @record to "jobs.jsonl"` produces stdout lines. Discovered in quickstart doc test 0892317e.
