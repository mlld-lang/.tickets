# Update plugin skills to reference mlld howto and mlld example

Update plugins/mlld/ skills (agents, orchestrator, llm-first) to reference 'mlld example <name>' for working code and 'mlld howto <topic>' for syntax details instead of embedding inline examples. Also update skills to mention keyword search in howto (e.g., 'run mlld howto routing to find routing patterns'). Blocked on: mlld example CLI command (m-f462). Skills currently embed ~30-50 code examples each — most can become references. Skills should keep architectural guidance but stop duplicating syntax reference.
