# Parse errors from multi-line import report wrong location

When a multi-line import fails to parse, the error location points to a directive far downstream (e.g., a loop 140 lines later) rather than the import itself. The parser should either: (a) support multi-line imports, or (b) report the error at the actual import line with a clear message like 'imports must be on a single line'.


**2026-02-12 12:50 UTC:** Validated and locked with regression coverage: added grammar test asserting malformed multi-line import errors are anchored at import line/column via mlldErrorLocation. Full npm test passes.
