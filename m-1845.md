# bug: orchestrator.ts wraps JSON/JSONL parse errors with generic message

## Problem

When a JSON or JSONL file fails to parse during file loading, `orchestrator.ts` wraps the specific parse error with a generic "Failed to load content" message, hiding the actual cause from the user.

## Expected behavior

The user should see the underlying parse error (e.g., "Unexpected token at line 3, column 5") so they can fix their file.

## Actual behavior

The user sees "Failed to load content: <path>" with no details about what went wrong.

## Where to look

- `interpreter/` — search for "Failed to load content" string
- The error wrapping likely happens in the content loading pipeline, possibly in `interpreter/eval/content-loader.ts` or similar
- The fix should preserve the original error message while adding the file path context

## Fix approach

When catching JSON/JSONL parse errors, include the original error message:
`Failed to load content: <path> — <original error message>`

Or better: throw the original error with the path added as context.

**2026-02-16 17:16 UTC:** Preserved JSON/JSONL parse diagnostics in content-loader orchestrator errors, added regression in interpreter/eval/content-loader.test.ts, and verified with npm test.
