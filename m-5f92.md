# Fix builtins doc: @log() is not a callable function

## What's wrong

`docs/src/atoms/syntax/builtins.md` (around line 72, under "Effects") lists:

```
- `@log(message)` - log message (when logging enabled)
```

This implies `@log()` is a callable function like `@exists()` or `@typeof()`. It is not. `log` is a **directive** (like `show`, `output`, `append`). You use it as `log "message"` or `log @variable`.

## Fix

In builtins.md, change the `@log(message)` entry to match how directives are documented elsewhere. Either:
- Change to `log <value>` without the `@` prefix and parentheses
- Or move it out of the builtins list entirely and reference it as a directive, alongside `show`/`output`/`append`
