# Grammar: ?? with backtick template RHS fails inside for-parallel blocks

Nullish coalescing (??) with a backtick template as the right-hand operand fails to parse inside for-parallel block bodies. String literal RHS works fine. Example: let @x = @item.id ?? `fallback-@mx.for.index` fails with 'Expected end of input'. Workaround: use a string literal or compute the fallback in a separate let.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ?? with backtick template RHS parses in all block contexts (for, for parallel, loop, if). 2. Existing ?? with string literal RHS behavior unchanged.
