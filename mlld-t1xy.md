# Add mlld howto --examples flag for cookbook coverage

Implement --examples flag that shows cookbook examples using a specific feature. Tag atoms with features used, build index for discovery. Example: mlld howto when --examples shows cookbook entries using when.

## Notes

**2026-01-30**: Assessed as valid feature request. Verified `mlld howto --help` shows no --examples flag currently.
