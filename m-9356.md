# doc: .jsonl file loading auto-parses to array

.jsonl file loading auto-parses each line as JSON and returns an array of objects. This is undocumented — file-loading-basics atom only covers .json auto-parse. Discovered during doc-writer orchestrator development when .trim().split(newline) failed on the already-parsed array. Should be documented in file-loading-basics or a new atom.


**2026-02-16 10:02 UTC:** Related: m-2228 (the .trim() inconsistency bug). The doc gap is still valid — .jsonl auto-parse should be documented regardless of the bug fix.

**2026-02-16 10:06 UTC:** Documented .jsonl auto-parse behavior in file-loading-basics; added docs fixture update; full npm test passes; commit 9838af8a9
