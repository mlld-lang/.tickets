# Run the dual-audit airlock implementation end-to-end and verify all Phase 3 success criteria. Run mlld run j2bd/security/impl, verify sign/verify, taint, policy enforcement, guard enforcement, safe/adversarial cases, and non-privileged label clearing restriction.


**2026-02-09 14:05 UTC:** Phase 3 verification complete. All 9/9 criteria PASS: (a) demo runs end-to-end, (b) sign/verify works, (c) taint accumulation works, (d) policy enforcement blocks untrusted→destructive, (e) guard enforcement requires verify, (f) safe case approves, (g) adversarial case rejects, (h) information bottleneck structurally confirmed, (i) non-privileged label clearing gets PROTECTED_LABEL_REMOVAL error.
