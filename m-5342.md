# Update Phase 1 prompt with validation step

Add to phase1-flail.att: 'After writing your experiment script, run mlld validate <path> before executing. If validation fails, fix your syntax first. This catches common mistakes like wrong comment syntax, assignment errors, and parse issues.' Addresses trend-13 without suppressing exploration.


**2026-02-15 22:44 UTC:** Updated phase1-flail.att: added 'mlld howto gotchas' to reading list (line 141-144) and added validation step before running experiments (line 145). Addresses trend findings about agents not reading gotchas and not validating syntax.
