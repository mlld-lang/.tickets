# Final review: built-in rules job

## High Polish Final Review

Adversarial verification passed (m-1cd0). All 13 exit criteria verified:
- defaults.rules documented with concrete examples ✓
- rule names map to data-label/risk-classification pairs ✓
- policy.operations section explained with examples ✓
- two-step pattern documented ✓
- All 4 built-in rules work correctly ✓
- Error messages include rule names ✓

## Review Scope

**Starting commit**: ee9a61f07 (merge-base with main)
**Branch**: j2bd/security

**Key files to review**:
- docs/src/atoms/security/policy-operations.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/labels-sensitivity.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/labels-trust.md
- j2bd/security/artifacts/builtin-rules-demo.mld
- src/services/policy-guard-generator.ts (policy.operations mapping)

**Diff command**: git diff ee9a61f07..HEAD -- docs/src/atoms/security/ src/services/policy-guard-generator.ts

## Rating Requirements

For high polish, rating must be 'solid' or better. Assess:
1. Documentation accuracy - do docs match implementation?
2. Example quality - are examples clear and self-contained?
3. Error messages - are they helpful?
4. Edge case handling - reasonable variations work?

## Minor Gap Noted

Adversarial worker noted: 'two-step pattern' terminology not explicitly used in docs. The concept is documented as 'Semantic labels with mapping'. Consider whether explicit naming would help discoverability.


**2026-02-05 20:01 UTC:** Final review completed successfully. Worker assessment: 'This is well-implemented work. The code is clean, tests pass, documentation is accurate.' Rating: solid. All exit criteria verified.
