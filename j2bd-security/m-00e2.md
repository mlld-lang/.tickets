# Final review: security feature documentation and implementation

## Final Review

This is the Phase 5 final review for the security feature J2BD.

### Context

All prior phases have passed:
- Phase 1 (Documentation): 5 atoms written and validated
- Phase 2 (Implementation): main.mld runs successfully
- Phase 3 (Verification): All tests pass (3226 total)
- Phase 4 (Adversarial): 15/15 exit criteria PASS, 6/6 additional tests PASS

### Your Task

Review ALL code changes holistically:

1. **Code Diff**: Compare current HEAD to merge-base `ee9a61f07`
   - Run: `git diff ee9a61f07...HEAD -- '*.ts' '*.mld' '*.md'`
   - Focus on: interpreter/, core/, docs/src/atoms/security/

2. **Documentation Accuracy**: Read each security atom and verify claims match implementation
   - Does `influenced` label actually get applied per labels-influenced.md?
   - Does `sign`/`verify` work as documented in sign-verify.md?
   - Does `autoverify` inject as documented in autosign-autoverify.md?

3. **Categorical vs Narrow**: Are fixes categorical or narrow patches?
   - Look for: hardcoded values, special-case checks, incomplete handling
   - Reject: fixes that pass tests but don't generalize

4. **End-to-End Flow**: Run llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/main.mld and assess
   - Does output make sense?
   - Would a new user understand what's happening?

### Return Format

Return `status: "approved"` only if work is categorically sound.
Return `status: "rejected"` with specific issues if fixes are narrow or docs are inaccurate.

### Rating Scale

- **excellent**: Polished, clear, would delight users
- **adequate**: Works correctly, minor polish opportunities
- **narrow**: Passes tests but fixes feel hacky/incomplete
- **broken**: Fundamental issues need addressing


**2026-02-04 22:15 UTC:** Final review confirmed: 367 commits reviewed, 3226 tests pass, all documentation claims match implementation behavior. Work is categorically sound - ready for completion.
