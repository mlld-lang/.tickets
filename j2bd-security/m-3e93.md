# Write labels-trust atom

Write the labels-trust atom covering:

1. Trust labels (`trusted`/`untrusted`) - what they mean, how to declare them
2. Trust asymmetry (untrusted is sticky, trusted requires privilege to restore)
3. The `no-untrusted-destructive` rule that blocks untrusted data from flowing to destructive operations
4. The `no-untrusted-privileged` rule
5. Working examples showing:
   - Declaring untrusted variables
   - Labeling operations as `destructive`
   - How the rule blocks the flow
   - Error messages including rule name

This atom completes Phase 1 documentation requirement for trust labels alongside the existing labels-sensitivity atom.

Location: /Users/adam/dev/mlld/docs/src/atoms/security/labels-trust.md

Format: 100-200 words focused atom with working mlld examples. Use `/mlld` skill for syntax and `mlld validate` to verify examples.
