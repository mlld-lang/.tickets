# Excellence assessment: reusable environment module user experience

## Excellence Assessment - High Polish Final Gate

Evaluate the end-to-end user experience for the reusable environment module feature.

### Artifacts to Evaluate

**Documentation:**
- docs/src/atoms/security/env-overview.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/env-config.md  
- docs/src/atoms/security/policy-auth.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/policy-composition.md

**Implementation:**
- pipeline/env-module/index.mld (the reusable module)
- pipeline/env-module-demo.mld (usage demo)

### Evaluation Criteria

Answer these questions:

1. **Would this feature delight a new user?** Not just work - would they recommend it?
2. **Are examples clear and self-contained?** Could someone copy-paste and succeed?
3. **Do error messages guide users to solutions?** Not just 'error' but 'here's how to fix it'
4. **Are common mistakes caught with helpful warnings?** Think about what a new user might try
5. **Is the getting-started experience smooth?** Can they go from zero to working in one session?

### Quality Standards

For high polish:
- Examples should work exactly as written with minimal setup
- Documentation should answer 'why' not just 'how'
- Edge cases that users will hit should be documented
- The progression from overview → config → auth → composition should feel natural

### Output

Return:
- `rating`: 'excellent', 'good', 'adequate', 'needs-work'
- `polish_gaps`: List of specific improvements needed (if any)
- `fundamental_gaps`: Issues requiring major work (if any)
- `recommendation`: 'complete', 'fix-polish', or 'escalate-for-scope'
