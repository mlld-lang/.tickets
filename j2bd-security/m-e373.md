# Phase 5: Final review of security protections demo job

Phase 5 final review of ALL changes for the security protections demo job.

**Starting commit:** c35be6306^ (compare with: git diff c35be6306^..HEAD)

**Files to review:**
- docs/src/atoms/security/examples/protection-demo.mld (main entry point)
- docs/src/atoms/security/examples/protection-1-secret.mld (secret exfil)
- docs/src/atoms/security/examples/protection-2-mcp.mld (MCP restriction)
- docs/src/atoms/security/examples/protection-3-pii.mld (PII redaction)
- docs/src/atoms/security/examples/protection-4-errors.mld (error messages)

**Exit criteria verified by adversarial (m-e2f9):**
1. Secret exfil blocked - PASS (3 bypass attempts all blocked)
2. MCP data restriction - PASS (documented as intentional design)
3. PII redaction - PASS (guard intercepts show/log)
4. Clear error messages - PASS (all components present)

**Review checklist:**
- [ ] Documentation accuracy - do the demo files accurately describe what mlld can do?
- [ ] Code quality - are the examples clear and follow mlld idioms?
- [ ] Categorical vs narrow - do the protections work categorically or just for specific test cases?
- [ ] User experience - would a new user understand how to use these protections?
- [ ] Protection 2 documentation - is the limitation about src:mcp clearly explained?

**Adversarial friction points (non-blocking):**
- PII guard doesn't handle object inputs (throws TypeError on non-strings)
- PII regex misses some formats (SSN with spaces/dots)
These are polish issues, not exit criteria blockers.
