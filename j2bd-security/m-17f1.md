# Phase 5: Final review of sandbox-agent job

Holistic final review of ALL sandbox-agent artifacts.

## Scope

Review these artifacts for accuracy, completeness, and quality:

### Documentation (5 atoms)
1. docs/src/atoms/security/env-overview.md
2. docs/src/atoms/security/env-config.md
3. docs/src/atoms/security/env-blocks.md
4. docs/src/atoms/security/policy-auth.md
5. docs/src/atoms/security/policy-capabilities.md

### Implementation
6. llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/sandbox-demo.mld

### Code changes on this branch (git diff main..HEAD for these files)
7. core/policy/guards.ts - policy guard generation
8. interpreter/eval/policy.ts - policy evaluation
9. Any other modified files in git status

## Review Criteria

1. **Documentation accuracy**: Do atoms accurately describe what mlld actually does? No overclaiming.
2. **Example validity**: Do all code examples use valid mlld syntax?
3. **Implementation correctness**: Does sandbox-demo.mld demonstrate all 5 sandbox aspects correctly?
4. **Enforcement layer honesty**: Are Docker-enforced vs mlld-enforced restrictions clearly distinguished?
5. **Completeness**: Does a new user have enough information to set up a sandbox?
6. **Cross-references**: Do atoms reference each other appropriately?
7. **Edge cases**: Are limitations documented honestly?

## Adversarial Results Summary
- 6/6 exit criteria PASS
- 10/10 additional bypass tests PASS
- Shell deny: 4 bypass vectors tested, all blocked
- Command allow: bidirectional (allows git, blocks rm/curl)
- Network deny: overrides allow list
- Secret protection: 5 bypass vectors tested (copy, exe passthrough, log, cmd interp, auth config read)
- Docker enforcement: config structure verified (cannot test Docker in CI)

## Rating Scale
- broken: Fundamental issues, needs major rework
- narrow: Fixes are point-wise, not categorical
- adequate: Works but rough edges
- solid: Quality work, good for users
- excellent: Delightful, best-in-class

High polish requires 'solid' or better.
