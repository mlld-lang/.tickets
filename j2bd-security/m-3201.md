# Implement end-to-end audit guard demonstration

Create a working demonstration of the full audit guard pattern that exercises all the security features documented in Phase 1 atoms.

Requirements from Success Criteria:
- [ ] Signed audit template that can be verified
- [ ] First agent that processes untrusted data (outputs get `influenced` label)
- [ ] Auditor agent that verifies its own instructions before trusting them
- [ ] Guard that blocks action if audit fails or verification fails
- [ ] End-to-end flow showing: untrusted input → influenced output → audit → action/rejection

Target location: Create implementation in llm/run/j2bd/security-demo/ or similar.

The implementation should match the target example code in the job spec, demonstrating:
1. sign @auditCriteria by "security-team" with sha256
2. exe llm @processData processing untrusted MCP data
3. influenced label applied to @processed
4. exe llm @audit with autoverify injection
5. Conditional action based on audit result

This tests the mlld interpreter's actual support for these features.


**2026-02-03 03:28 UTC:** Friction reported: mlld validate crashed on security labels. Spawned ticket m-c1ed which has now been fixed.
