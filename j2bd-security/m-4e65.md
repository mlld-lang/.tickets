# Fix @local reserved name in docs + add composition cross-ref

Two doc fixes needed from adversarial findings:

1. **policy-composition.md line 19**: `/policy @local = union(@localConfig)` uses `@local` which is a reserved resolver prefix. Rename to `/policy @localPolicy = union(@localConfig)`. This is a simple find-and-replace on that one line.

2. **policy-label-flow.md**: Add a brief composition note at the end (before the See references). Something like: 'Label rules compose across policies via union — a label deny from any composed policy applies to the merged policy. See `policy-composition` for composition semantics.' This addresses the adversarial finding that all label flow examples show single-policy context.

Both are minimal doc edits. No code changes needed.
