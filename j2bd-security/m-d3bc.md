# Add self-contained inline example to policy-composition atom

policy-composition.md examples 1 and 2 reference external files (baseline.mld, company.mld, policy-one.mld, policy-two.mld). Add one self-contained inline example showing two policies composed in one file with intersection visible. See PG-1 in worker-m-a7fc-0.json.
