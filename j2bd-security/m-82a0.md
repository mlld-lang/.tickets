# Fix policy-auth.md bare @send() call

In docs/src/atoms/security/policy-auth.md line 69, the bare `@send()` call is invalid in strict mode. Change it to `show @send()`.

Specific fix:
- File: docs/src/atoms/security/policy-auth.md
- Line 69: Change `@send()` to `show @send()`

This is inside the label flow checks code block (lines 60-70).


**2026-02-09 19:00 UTC:** Changed bare @send() to show @send() on line 69 of docs/src/atoms/security/policy-auth.md.
