# Phase 5: Final review of dual-audit airlock job

Phase 5 final review of ALL changes for the dual-audit airlock security job.

- llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/prompts/security-policy.att (NEW)

Key items to review:
1. guards-privileged atom accuracy — adversarial found ALL label removal requires privilege (not just protected labels). The atom's wording implies only protected labels are restricted. Is the atom accurate?
2. pattern-dual-audit atom completeness — does it adequately explain the pattern for a new user?
3. Implementation demo (main.mld) — does it demonstrate the full dual-audit flow clearly? Are mock exes well-explained?
4. The demo uses plain exe mocks (not exe llm) because guard @ensureVerified fires in standalone mode with empty @mx.tools.calls. Is the mock pattern well-documented?
5. Friction: autoverify only fires when signed variable is @-referenced in command template (not when passed as parameter). Is this documented anywhere?
6. Are there any documentation/implementation mismatches?

Rating required: 'solid' or better for high polish.


**2026-02-09 14:48 UTC:** Rating: solid. Both fixes from first review iteration (guards-privileged accuracy, main.mld guard timing) verified correct. No narrow fixes found. Ready for excellence assessment.
