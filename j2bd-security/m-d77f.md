# Phase 5: Final review of audit guard security implementation

Holistic review of ALL changes since job started. Starting commit: f0d52c756. Changes span: 223851ee3 (Phase 2 impl), a14b8beef (post-hook guard fix), b11e9b59e (main.mld restructure). Review code diffs, documentation atoms, implementation artifacts. Assess quality for high-polish bar: solid or better rating required.


**2026-02-09 10:05 UTC:** Duplicate of m-1ddc which completed the final review with 'solid' rating and status: 'approved'. Closing as stale.
