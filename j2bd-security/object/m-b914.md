# Document labels-trust: trusted/untrusted mechanics

Create documentation for the labels-trust atom covering:

1. What trusted/untrusted labels mean in mlld
2. How trust is established and revoked
3. How trust propagates through operations
4. Common patterns for working with trust levels
5. Security implications of trust decisions

This builds on labels-overview and labels-source-auto which are already complete. Trust is foundational for policy enforcement and guard behavior.

Reference: plan.md shows this as the next uncompleted item in the Labels priority group.
