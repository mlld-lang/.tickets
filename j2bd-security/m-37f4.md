# Excellence assessment: sandbox-agent end-to-end UX

High polish requires an excellence assessment after final review passes with 'solid' or better.

Evaluate the end-to-end user experience for the sandbox-agent feature:

1. **New user journey**: Could a user who reads only the 5 atoms (env-overview, env-config, env-blocks, policy-auth, policy-capabilities) successfully create a sandboxed agent environment? Are there gaps in the learning path?

2. **Example clarity**: Are the code examples in each atom self-contained and clear? Would a user understand what each piece does without external context?

3. **Error experience**: When a user hits a restriction (denied shell, blocked command, secret exfil attempt), are the error messages helpful? Do they guide toward a solution?

4. **Common mistakes**: Are likely mistakes caught with helpful warnings? (e.g., using tools field expecting it to block commands, forgetting danger: ['@keychain'] for keychain access)

5. **Getting started smoothness**: How many steps from 'I want to sandbox an agent' to 'it works'? Is sandbox-demo.mld a good starting point?

6. **Documentation accuracy**: Do the atoms accurately reflect what the implementation does? Any overclaims or underdocumented behaviors?

Artifacts to review:
- docs/src/atoms/security/env-overview.md (was this created? check docs/src/atoms/security/ for all env-* and policy-* atoms, and also check docs/src/atoms/environments/ directory)
- llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/main.mld (sandbox-demo implementation)
- core/policy/guards.ts (enforcement)
- core/policy/denial-helpers.ts (error messages)
- tests/cases/exceptions/security/ (error test fixtures)

Rate the overall polish and identify specific gaps to address.


**2026-02-09 19:30 UTC:** Excellence assessment re-run after remediation: rating upgraded from 'adequate' to 'solid'. All 3 fixes verified: cross-references corrected, tools-vs-capabilities warning prominently added, mcps field documented. Remaining polish items (reading-order guidance, label flow suggestions) are lower priority and do not block completion.
