# Fix @local in test case + complete cross-references in atom frontmatter

Final review rated 'adequate', need 'solid' for high polish. Two fixes needed:

## 1. Rename @local in test case

File: tests/cases/security/policy-composition-layers/example.md line 6
- Change `/import policy @local from "./layer-local-override.mld"` to `/import policy @localOverride from "./layer-local-override.mld"`

File: tests/cases/security/policy-composition-layers/expected.md line 16
- Change `"local"` to `"localOverride"` in the activePolicies array output

Reason: @local is a reserved resolver prefix in projects with mlld-config.json. The test passes in VFS but would confuse users copying the pattern.

## 2. Complete cross-references in related: frontmatter

Make related: fields bidirectional across all 4 policy atoms:

- **policies.md** (line 8): Add policy-composition, policy-capabilities, policy-label-flow to related list
  - Current: `related: [security-guards-basics, security-needs-declaration, policy-operations]`
  - Target: `related: [security-guards-basics, security-needs-declaration, policy-operations, policy-composition, policy-capabilities, policy-label-flow]`

- **policy-composition.md** (line 8): Add policy-label-flow to related list
  - Current: `related: [security-policies, policy-capabilities, policy-auth]`
  - Target: `related: [security-policies, policy-capabilities, policy-auth, policy-label-flow]`

- **policy-capabilities.md** (line 8): Add policy-composition and policy-label-flow to related list
  - Current: `related: [security-policies, policy-auth, env-config]`
  - Target: `related: [security-policies, policy-auth, env-config, policy-composition, policy-label-flow]`

- **policy-label-flow.md** (line 8): Already has policy-composition — no change needed.

Run `npm run build:fixtures` after test case changes and verify tests pass.
