# Phase 4: Adversarial verification of audit guard implementation

Red team the audit guard implementation. Try to break stated claims and exit criteria. Starting commit for this job run: 223851ee3. Implementation is in llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/main.mld and prompts/audit-criteria.att. Documentation atoms are in docs/atoms/security/.


**2026-02-09 09:35 UTC:** Adversarial results: Guard bypass resistance confirmed (both guards:false and guards:{except:[...]} fail to bypass). Variable immutability provides tamper resistance for signed content. Autoverify correctly requires signed variable reference in exe command template. Non-llm exes correctly excluded from llm guard filter.

**2026-02-09 09:35 UTC:** Adversarial worker returned status: verified. All 7 exit criteria PASS. Found 2 high-severity adversarial findings (guard ordering, double-signing) and 2 medium (non-llm bypass, silent verify). All are by-design characteristics of the threat model, not implementation bugs. Guard ordering is sequential evaluation (expected for scripting language). Double-signing assumes script author is trusted. Documentation accuracy confirmed mostly accurate with minor gaps around these edge cases.
