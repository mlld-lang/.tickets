# Excellence remediation: fix atom cross-refs and tools/capabilities warning

Excellence assessment rated adequate. Fix these issues to reach solid: (1) Fix broken related IDs in env-overview, env-blocks, env-config frontmatter (policies->security-policies, guards-basics->security-guards-basics). (2) Add prominent tools vs capabilities warning to env-config after the table. (3) Add mcps field to env-config table.
