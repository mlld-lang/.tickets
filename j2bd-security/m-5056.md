# Phase 3: Verify security demo with full syntax

## Context

The validate bug (m-c1ed) is now fixed. The demo at llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/main.mld works but uses mock implementations and has comments noting workarounds for the bug.

## Tasks

1. Update demo to use full security syntax:
   - `var untrusted @externalData = ...`
   - `exe llm @processTask(data) = ...`
   - Remove comments about 'validate bug'

2. Verify Phase 3 criteria:
   - [ ] Run `mlld validate` on the demo (should pass now)
   - [ ] Run the demo end-to-end
   - [ ] Verify `influenced` label is applied to LLM outputs (check interpreter tests)
   - [ ] Verify `sign` and `verify` directives work
   - [ ] Verify `autoverify` policy concept is demonstrated
   - [ ] Test injection attack is detected and blocked

3. If any gaps found, create friction tickets

## Acceptance

Demo runs successfully with full security label syntax. All Phase 3 verification criteria checked.
