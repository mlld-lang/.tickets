# Final review: builtin-rules job

## Final Review

Holistically review ALL code changes, documentation, and artifacts produced during this job.

### Commit Range

```bash
git diff aece1b804..HEAD
```

Starting commit: aece1b804 (Add j2bd security job drafts)

### What to Review

1. **Atoms created/modified:**
   - docs/src/atoms/security/labels-trust.md
   - docs/src/atoms/security/labels-sensitivity.md  
   - docs/src/atoms/security/policy-label-flow.md
   - docs/src/atoms/security/policies.md

2. **Artifacts:**
   - j2bd/security/artifacts/builtin-rules-demo.mld

3. **Adversarial test files:**
   - tmp/adversarial-*.mld (10 files)

### Review Criteria

- Do documentation promises match implementation reality?
- Are fixes categorical or narrow? (e.g., did we fix the pattern or just the specific case?)
- Are there systemic issues across the changes?
- Would a new user succeed with this feature based on documentation alone?
- Are error messages helpful with rule names and actionable suggestions?

### Exit Criteria Verified by Adversarial

All 4 exit criteria passed:
1. Built-in rules enforce common protections with minimal config - PASS
2. no-secret-exfil blocks secret->exfil - PASS
3. no-untrusted-destructive blocks untrusted->destructive - PASS
4. Error messages include rule name - PASS

### Expected Output

Return a rating: "broken", "narrow", "adequate", "solid", or "excellent"

For high polish, we need "solid" or better to proceed to completion. If rating is "adequate" or lower, create tickets for the gaps.
