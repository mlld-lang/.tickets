# Excellence assessment: security documentation end-to-end UX

## Context

Final review completed with 'solid' rating. High polish quality bar requires excellence assessment.

## Scope

Evaluate the end-to-end user experience for someone trying to:
1. Protect API keys from leaking to network calls
2. Restrict MCP data from destructive operations
3. Redact PII in logs/output
4. Understand blocked operations via error messages

## Areas to Assess

- Are the 4 atoms (labels-sensitivity, labels-source-auto, policy-label-flow, guards-basics) findable and understandable?
- Do the demo files (protection-1 through protection-4) actually run and demonstrate the protections?
- Is the getting started experience smooth?
- Are there common mistakes that should be caught with warnings?
- Would a new user succeed with just the documentation?

## Output

Rate as: delight / adequate / needs-work

If needs-work, identify specific polish gaps.
