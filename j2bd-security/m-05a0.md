# Write env-blocks atom

Write the env-blocks atom for docs/src/atoms/security/env-blocks.md.

This atom explains the `env @config [ ... ]` block syntax for scoped execution within an environment.

Key points to cover:
- env blocks scope tool access and capabilities
- Blocks can return values (=> syntax)
- Environment is released when block exits
- Composable with 'with' for inline derivation

Follow the format of existing atoms (see env-overview.md, env-config.md for reference):
- YAML frontmatter with id, title, brief, category, parent, tags, related, related-code, updated
- 100-200 words
- At least one working code example that passes mlld validate

Example code should demonstrate:
```mlld
var @config = { tools: ["Read", "Write"] }

var @result = env @config [
  log "Inside env block"
  => "completed"
]

show @result
```

Reference spec: Part 5.2 Environment Blocks. Related atoms: env-overview, env-config, policies.
