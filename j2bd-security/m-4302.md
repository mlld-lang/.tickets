# Write policy-label-flow atom

Write the policy-label-flow atom for docs/src/atoms/security/policy-label-flow.md. This atom explains deny rules for label combinations - how policy.labels defines which data labels cannot flow to which operation labels. Cover: (1) the labels block in policy config with deny/allow lists, (2) how deny rules reference operation labels (op:cmd, net:w, etc.), (3) prefix matching (op:cmd:git blocks all git subcommands), (4) most-specific-wins when allow and deny conflict, (5) working mlld code example that passes mlld validate. See spec Part 3 Section 3.4 for reference. Existing atoms labels-sensitivity and labels-source-auto show the pattern. 100-200 words with at least one working code example.
