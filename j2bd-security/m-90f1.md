# Fix excellence polish gaps in security atoms

Excellence assessment found 2 documentation polish gaps that should be fixed:

## 1. labels-source-auto.md path issue (small)
Line 34-38 uses `<./config.txt>` which fails when run from any directory except the file's location.

**Fix**: Change to `<@base/config.txt>` or add explanatory note about path resolution.

## 2. @mlld/production references (medium)
docs/user/security.md lines 22-31 reference @mlld/production, @mlld/development, @mlld/sandbox which don't exist.

**Options**:
- Remove/update the references to note these are 'examples' or 'planned'
- Or mark them as templates the user should copy/customize

The capability denial suggestion improvement (#3) requires interpreter code changes - out of scope for this doc job.

The getting-started guide (#4) was marked optional by the excellence worker.
