# Final review: MCP security job

## Final Review Required

This is a high-polish job that has passed adversarial verification (13/13 exit criteria). A final holistic review is needed before completion.

### Scope

Review ALL changes related to MCP security:

1. **Documentation atoms** (docs/src/atoms/security/):
   - mcp-import.md - MCP tool import syntax
   - mcp-security.md - Automatic src:mcp tainting
   - mcp-policy.md - Policy rules for MCP data
   - mcp-guards.md - Guards for MCP tool calls

2. **Implementation** (pipeline/):
   - mcp-security-demo.mld - End-to-end demonstration

3. **Supporting code** (if any changes were made to interpreter/runtime)

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Documentation promises match implementation reality
- [ ] Fixes are categorical (address root causes) not narrow (patch specific symptoms)
- [ ] Code examples in atoms actually work as documented
- [ ] Error messages guide users to solutions
- [ ] No systemic issues or gaps

### Rating Scale

Provide a rating:
- **broken**: Critical issues, cannot complete
- **narrow**: Fixes are too specific, gaps remain
- **adequate**: Works correctly, meets requirements
- **solid**: Well-designed, comprehensive
- **excellent**: Exceptional quality, delightful experience

For high-polish, rating must be 'solid' or better to proceed to excellence assessment.

### Starting Point for Diff

Recent security-related commits:
- 5ce9757f7 - Fix invalid guard syntax in mcp-guards.md
- c685e6d66 - Restructure security demos for independent verification
- c35be6306 - Add security protections demo example
