# Phase 5: Final review of reusable environment module job

## Context

Phases 1-4 complete for the reusable environment module J2BD job.

**Starting commit for diff**: Use `git log --oneline main..HEAD` to see all changes.

## What to Review

1. **Atoms created** (Phase 1):
   - docs/atoms/security/env-overview.md
   - docs/atoms/security/env-config.md
   - docs/atoms/security/policy-auth.md
   - docs/atoms/security/policy-composition.md
   - docs/atoms/security/modules-exporting.md

2. **Implementation** (Phase 2):
   - examples/env-modules/claude-dev/index.mld
   - examples/env-modules/claude-dev/demo-usage.mld

3. **Exit Criteria** verified by adversarial:
   - User can create packaged env module with @spawn/@shell exports
   - Profile system with full/readonly variants
   - Credential flow using policy.auth
   - Another user can import and use the module

## Review Focus

- Do the atoms accurately describe the implementation?
- Are the examples working and self-documenting?
- Would a new user succeed based on docs alone?
- Are error messages helpful?
- Rate: broken / narrow / adequate / solid / excellent

Medium polish requires at least 'adequate' rating.
