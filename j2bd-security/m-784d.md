# Final review: reusable environment module job

## Final Review - Phase 5

Perform a holistic review of ALL code changes, documentation, and artifacts produced during this job.

### Starting Point for Diff

Merge base commit: `ee9a61f07d6d61712e7f676277d9710ff4605afd`

Run: `git diff ee9a61f07..HEAD -- docs/src/atoms/security/ pipeline/env-module/`

### Artifacts to Review

**Documentation atoms:**
- docs/src/atoms/security/env-overview.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/env-config.md  
- docs/src/atoms/security/policy-auth.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/policy-composition.md

**Implementation:**
- pipeline/env-module/index.mld (the reusable module)
- pipeline/env-module-demo.mld (usage demo)

### Review Checklist

1. **Code Quality**: Are the fixes categorical or narrowly patched? Would they handle variations?
2. **Documentation Accuracy**: Do the atoms' promises match what the implementation actually delivers?
3. **Example Validity**: Do all code examples in atoms pass `mlld validate`?
4. **User Experience**: Would a new user succeed with this feature based on the documentation alone?
5. **Systemic Issues**: Are there patterns that suggest broader problems?

### Quality Bar: High Polish

Rating must be at least 'adequate'. Look for:
- Clear, self-contained examples
- Helpful error messages
- Smooth getting-started experience
- No documentation/implementation mismatches


**2026-02-04 23:04 UTC:** Final review assessment: 32 commits reviewed, 1857 lines changed. No systemic issues or narrow fixes identified. Ready for excellence assessment.
