# Final Review: MCP security job holistic assessment

Phase 5 final review for the MCP security J2BD job.

**Starting commit**: 67462649da (merge-base with main)
**Branch**: j2bd/security

**What to review:**
1. All 4 atoms: mcp-security, mcp-policy, mcp-guards, env-config
2. Implementation artifacts: llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/main.mld and related
3. Code changes: core/policy/*, interpreter/eval/policy.ts, interpreter/guards/*, core/errors/denial.ts
4. Test fixtures: tests/cases/exceptions/security/*
5. Environment module: pipeline/env-module/index.mld

**Key questions:**
- Do documentation promises match implementation reality?
- Are fixes categorical (covering all cases) or narrow (just fixing specific test cases)?
- Are error messages helpful for new users?
- Would a new user succeed with MCP security based on the docs alone?
- Is the work 'solid' quality (high polish requirement)?

**Exit criteria verified by adversarial worker:**
1. Artifact runs end-to-end ✓
2. src:mcp auto-taint on tool outputs ✓
3. Guard blocks secrets from MCP tools ✓
4. Policy restricts src:mcp data ✓
5. Profile-based tool availability ✓
6. Atom examples validate ✓

**Friction noted (not blocking):**
- Label modification syntax (trusted!, !label, clear!) described in spec Part 4.3 but not in grammar — spec-vs-impl gap, not a bug
- 429 rate limit noise from fake MCP server — cosmetic only


**2026-02-09 20:01 UTC:** Rating: solid. No narrow fixes found. Should_complete: true per reviewer.
