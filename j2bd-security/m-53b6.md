# Phase 3 verification: test env module syntax and execution

Verify the reusable environment module implementation works:

1. Run `mlld validate` on examples/env-modules/claude-dev/index.mld
2. Run `mlld validate` on examples/env-modules/demo-usage.mld
3. Verify `profiles { }` block parses correctly
4. Verify `policy @config = { auth: { } }` pattern works
5. Verify `using auth:name` syntax in exe definitions works

If any syntax fails validation, investigate whether it's a documentation issue (syntax doesn't exist) or implementation gap (syntax should work but doesn't).

Starting commit: b0deaaa31


**2026-02-05 14:14 UTC:** Verification passed. Friction point documented: profiles directive lacks dedicated test coverage but parses correctly.
