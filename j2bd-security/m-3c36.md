# Adversarial re-verification: sandbox exit criteria unmet

Previous adversarial run (m-74f6) returned failures_found but was closed without re-verification. Exit criteria items not proven: (1) Tool restrictions - never tested, Test 11 was BLOCKED, (2) Credential protection - only works with explicit guards not shown in target example. Docker fs/net/limits are proven. capabilities.allow is proven. This ticket requires dispatching an adversarial worker (task_type: adversarial) to re-run verification against the current state. The worker must return status: verified before this ticket can close.


**2026-02-03 18:56 UTC:** Adversarial v2 results: capabilities.allow ENFORCED, Docker net/fs isolation ENFORCED, secret labels with guards ENFORCED, and documented limitations (capabilities.deny, defaults.rules, tool restrictions) confirmed as NOT enforced - matching documentation claims exactly.
