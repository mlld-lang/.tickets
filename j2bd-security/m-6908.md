# Final review of audit-guard-pattern job

## Final Review Required

Adversarial verification passed with 5/5 exit criteria:
1. PASS - sign directive creates signatures (SHA-256, signedby, signedat)
2. PASS - exe llm processing untrusted produces influenced label
3. PASS - autoverify injects MLLD_VERIFY_VARS and verification instructions
4. PASS - when/else pattern blocks on audit.approved=false
5. PASS - end-to-end flow: untrusted→influenced→audit→rejection

## Review Scope

**Starting commit**: Run `git merge-base main HEAD` to find the divergence point, then `git diff <base>..HEAD` to see all changes.

**Documentation**:
- docs/src/atoms/security/signing-overview.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/sign-verify.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/autosign-autoverify.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/labels-influenced.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/pattern-audit-guard.md

**Implementation**:
- llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/main.mld - main demo
- llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/prompts/audit-criteria.att - audit template

**Review checklist**:
- [ ] Do examples in atoms validate with `mlld validate`?
- [ ] Does documentation accurately describe implementation?
- [ ] Are fixes categorical or narrow? (check for band-aid fixes)
- [ ] Would a new user succeed with this feature based on docs alone?
- [ ] Rate overall quality: broken / narrow / adequate / solid / excellent

**High polish requirement**: Rating must be 'solid' or better to proceed to excellence assessment.
