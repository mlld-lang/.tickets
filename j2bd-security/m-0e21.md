# Verify audit ledger taint propagation end-to-end

Phase 3 verification ticket. Verify the three success criteria:

1. **write events record path, taint, and writer**: Inspect the audit logging code to confirm write events include all three fields. Check `core/security/AuditLogger.ts` and `interpreter/utils/audit-log.ts` for the write event structure.

2. **read values inherit taint from latest write**: Inspect the file-read path to confirm it consults the audit log for prior write events and applies recorded taint. Check how `<file.txt>` file loads restore labels.

3. **Note any missing event types or missing fields**: Compare the audit-log atom's documented event types (label, bless, conflict, sign, verify, write) against the actual implementation. Report any gaps.

Additionally, try running `mlld validate llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/audit-ledger-demo.mld` to confirm the demo script is syntactically valid. If possible, try running it end-to-end to see actual output.

Report findings as a structured verification result with PASS/FAIL for each criterion and notes on any gaps found.


**2026-02-09 10:26 UTC:** Verification worker confirmed all code paths. Runtime code matches audit-log atom documentation exactly.
