# Phase 3: Verify MCP security artifacts end-to-end

Run the MCP security demonstration artifacts end-to-end and verify each exit criterion.

## Verification Checklist

1. **Run mcp-security-demo.mld** end-to-end with `npx mlld j2bd/security/artifacts/mcp-security-demo.mld`
2. **Verify src:mcp auto-taint**: Scenario 1 output should show MCP tool outputs carry taint
3. **Verify guard blocking secrets**: Scenario 2 should show guard denying secret data from MCP exe
4. **Verify policy restricting src:mcp**: Scenario 3 should demonstrate policy blocks MCP data from destructive ops
5. **Verify profile-based tool availability**: Scenario 4 should show different profiles getting different tools
6. **Verify mcp-env-module.mld**: Import as module, verify exports work and @mcpConfig() adapts to profiles
7. **Check all 4 atoms** (docs/src/atoms/security/mcp-security.md, mcp-policy.md, mcp-guards.md, docs/src/atoms/security/env-config.md) - verify code examples are accurate to what actually runs

## Report Format

For each exit criterion, report PASS/FAIL with evidence (actual output).

If anything fails, document the specific failure and suggest remediation.


**2026-02-06 01:32 UTC:** Phase 3 verification complete. All 7 exit criteria PASS. Demo runs end-to-end, src:mcp taint confirmed, guards block secrets, policy restricts MCP data, profile-based tool availability works, env module imports correctly, all 4 atom code examples validate and run. 3271 tests pass.
