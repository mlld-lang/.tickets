# Update env-config atom with @mcpConfig() pattern

The env-config.md atom currently documents basic environment configuration (provider, fs, net, limits, auth, tools) but is MISSING the @mcpConfig() function pattern which is central to the MCP integration scenario.

The target example requires:
1. Environment module with `profiles {}` block
2. `exe @mcpConfig() = when [...]` function that adapts to `@mx.profile`
3. Profile-based MCP server configuration

Update env-config.md to add a section documenting:
- The @mcpConfig() function exported from environment modules
- How it receives @mx.profile and returns server configuration
- Example showing profile-based MCP tool availability

Reference interpreter/eval/env-mcp-config.test.ts for working patterns.

Keep atom length 100-200 words. Run `mlld validate` on examples.
