# Polish doc atoms per excellence assessment findings

Excellence assessment found 4 addressable gaps (2 high, 2 medium). All are doc edits to existing atoms. See decision-16.json for full details.


**2026-02-09 10:05 UTC:** All 4 edits applied cleanly: (1) autoverify+guard callout in autosign-autoverify.md, (2) guard ordering WARNING in pattern-audit-guard.md, (3) signing explanation in signing-overview.md, (4) MCP note in pattern-audit-guard.md. New guard code block validated with npm run ast.
