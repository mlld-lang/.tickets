# Fix sandbox-demo.mld syntax errors

The sandbox-demo.mld at llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/sandbox-demo.mld has syntax errors.

**Error from mlld validate:**
```
Parse error: Unclosed object in /var directive. Expected closing brace to close the object. at line 18, column 1
```

**Investigation:**
Line 18 starts the @sandbox object. The issue is likely the multi-line object syntax or comment placement.

**Task:**
1. Fix the syntax errors in the sandbox-demo.mld file
2. Ensure `mlld validate llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/sandbox-demo.mld` passes
3. Ensure the demo can be run with `mlld llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/sandbox-demo.mld`

**Key constraint:** Do NOT change the documented functionality - fix syntax only.
