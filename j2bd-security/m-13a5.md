# Excellence assessment: Sandbox restrictions user experience

HIGH POLISH excellence assessment for sandbox-agent job (m-74f6).

## Context

Final review rated the implementation 'solid' with:
- 5 feature areas reviewed (4 solid, 1 adequate)
- 44 commits, 3472 lines changed
- Categorical fixes for label propagation
- Documentation accurately describes mechanisms

## Assessment Criteria

Evaluate the end-to-end user experience:

1. **Examples**: Are the sandbox-demo.mld examples clear and self-contained? Can a user copy-paste and run them?

2. **Error messages**: When a restriction blocks an operation, does the error message:
   - Clearly state what was blocked?
   - Explain WHY it was blocked (which policy rule)?
   - Suggest how to fix it (add to allow list, etc.)?

3. **Common mistakes**: Are common mistakes caught with helpful warnings?
   - Using `env { tools: [...] }` expecting command blocking (should suggest policy capabilities)
   - Typos in capability patterns
   - Missing Docker provider when expecting container isolation

4. **Getting started**: If a user wants to sandbox an agent:
   - Is there a clear starting point?
   - Are the 5 security atoms findable and in logical order?
   - Does the documentation explain the tradeoffs (local vs Docker isolation)?

5. **Would this delight?**: Would a new user recommend this to others?

## Artifacts to Review

- docs/src/atoms/security/env-overview.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/env-config.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/env-blocks.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/policy-auth.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/policy-capabilities.md
- demos/security/sandbox-demo.mld

## Output

Return assessment with:
- Each criterion rated (excellent/good/needs-work)
- Specific gaps identified
- Recommendation: complete as-is, or specific polish needed
