# Fix template variable security label loss during exe parameter binding

Template (derived) variables lose security labels when passed as exe parameters. In exec-invocation.ts:2023-2025, template variables are excluded from originalVariables (correct) but also leave guardVariableCandidates empty (incorrect). Fix: add guardVariableCandidates[i] = variable after the template exclusion on line 2025.


**2026-02-04 06:18 UTC:** Duplicate ticket - same issue as m-4ea2, fixed in commit b5dcd622b.
