# Excellence assessment: MCP security user experience

Evaluate the end-to-end user experience for MCP security as a new mlld user.

Final review rated this work as 'solid'. This excellence assessment is required by the high-polish quality bar (requirement #9).

Assess:
1. Walk through the 4 core atoms (mcp-security, mcp-policy, mcp-guards, env-config) as a new user. Are they self-contained? Do they build on each other logically?
2. Try the mcp-security-demo.mld artifact end-to-end. Does it work? Are the outputs clear?
3. Try the mcp-env-module.mld artifact. Does it validate? Is it clear what it does?
4. Are error messages helpful when things go wrong? (e.g., policy denials, guard blocks)
5. Are common mistakes caught with helpful warnings?
6. Would a new user recommend this feature to others?

Key files:
- docs/src/atoms/security/mcp-security.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/mcp-policy.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/mcp-guards.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/env-config.md
- j2bd/security/artifacts/mcp-security-demo.mld
- j2bd/security/artifacts/mcp-env-module.mld

Final review findings (all minor/nit, for reference):
- label-flow.test.ts tests src:exec but not src:mcp specifically
- config-spawner.test.ts only covers happy paths
- mcp-security atom example 1 triggers validator warning for @anthropic in import path
- Key quoting style inconsistency between atom examples and demo
- Profile fallback behavior undocumented


**2026-02-06 02:44 UTC:** Excellence assessment found rating 'solid' with actionable gaps. All gaps remediated: FG-1 security fix (guard error secret redaction) and PG-1-8 documentation polish. Ready for job completion.
