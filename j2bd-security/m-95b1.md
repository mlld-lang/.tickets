# Excellence assessment: audit ledger taint propagation UX

Evaluate the end-to-end user experience for the audit ledger taint propagation feature.

## Context
- Final review rated all 4 feature areas as 'solid'
- 5 atoms document the feature: audit-log, labels-sensitivity, labels-source-auto, label-tracking, policy-label-flow
- Working demo at llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/main.mld
- 3 friction points noted by adversarial (EffectHandler double-write, secondary read paths, path normalization) - assessed as non-blocking

## Evaluate
1. **First-contact experience**: If a developer reads the atoms in order, do they build a coherent mental model of how taint propagation works?
2. **Example clarity**: Are the mlld examples in each atom self-contained and runnable? Do they demonstrate the concept clearly?
3. **Error guidance**: If a user makes a common mistake (e.g., forgetting to label a variable as secret, reading from a path not in the audit log), would they understand what went wrong?
4. **Cross-referencing**: Do the atoms link to each other appropriately? Can a user navigate from 'I want to track sensitive data' to 'here's how the audit ledger records it'?
5. **Demo quality**: Does the main.mld demo tell a compelling story about WHY you'd use audit ledger taint propagation?

## Rating Scale
- **Delightful**: New users would recommend this feature to others
- **Solid**: Works well, documentation is clear, minor rough edges
- **Adequate**: Functional but could be better
- **Needs work**: Significant gaps in UX
