# Add policy.operations mapping to policy-operations atom

**Issue from final review m-4fc2:** The policy-operations.md atom documents direct exe labeling (exe exfil @fn) but does NOT document the policy.operations mapping feature implemented in commit 7c2027794.

**What's missing:** The two-step pattern where semantic labels like `net:w` map to risk categories for policy enforcement:

```mlld
var @policyConfig = {
  defaults: { rules: ['no-secret-exfil'] },
  operations: {
    'net:w': 'exfil',
    'op:cmd:rm': 'destructive'
  }
}
```

**Why it matters:** This is the intended design per the spec. Users who only read the atom won't discover this powerful pattern - they'll think they have to use `exe exfil` directly which is less flexible.

**Action:** Add a section to docs/src/atoms/security/policy-operations.md explaining the policy.operations mapping with a working example. Keep within 100-200 word limit by being concise.
