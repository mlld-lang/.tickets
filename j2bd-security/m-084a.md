# Adversarial verification: MCP security exit criteria

## Context

This is a fresh run. Prior work has completed:
- All 4 atoms exist and have validated examples
- Implementation demo (pipeline/mcp-security-demo.mld) runs successfully
- Verified: import works, taint mechanism works, guard blocking works

## Task

Adversarial verification of ALL exit criteria:

### Exit Criteria to Verify

1. **`import tools from mcp` syntax works**
   - Test: Run import and call a tool
   - Expected: Tool executes and returns result

2. **Automatic tainting works (`@result.mx.taint` includes 'src:mcp')**
   - Test: Call MCP tool, inspect result.mx.taint
   - Expected: taint array contains 'src:mcp'

3. **Guard can inspect/block MCP calls**
   - Test: Create guard, attempt blocked operation
   - Expected: Guard fires and blocks

4. **Secret data is blocked from flowing to MCP tools**
   - Test: Pass secret-labeled data to MCP tool
   - Expected: Guard denial

5. **Taint propagates through transformations**
   - Test: Transform MCP output, check taint persists
   - Expected: Derived value still has src:mcp

6. **Policy can restrict MCP data flows**
   - Test: Configure policy, attempt restricted operation
   - Expected: Policy blocks

### Adversarial Tests

Try to break the security model:
- Can taint be removed from MCP data?
- Can guards be bypassed for MCP calls?
- Does taint persist through complex transformations (nested objects, arrays)?
- Can secret data reach MCP tools through indirect paths?

## Deliverable

Return status: 'verified' with exit_criteria_results array showing PASS/FAIL for each criterion, OR status: 'failed' with specific failures.


**2026-02-04 23:17 UTC:** Created in error - this run is for audit-guard-pattern job, not MCP security.
