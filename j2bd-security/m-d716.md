# Excellence assessment: audit guard user experience

Final review rated the work as 'solid'. High polish requires excellence assessment of the end-to-end user experience.

Evaluate:
1. Would a new user succeed with the audit guard pattern from documentation alone?
2. Are the 5 doc atoms (signing-overview, sign-verify, autosign-autoverify, labels-influenced, pattern-audit-guard) clear and self-contained?
3. Do the atoms build on each other in a logical progression?
4. Is the demo (main.mld) understandable without deep mlld knowledge?
5. Are error messages helpful when things go wrong (guard blocks, verify fails)?
6. Are common mistakes caught with helpful warnings?
7. Would this feature delight a new user? Would they recommend it to others?

Starting commit: f0d52c756
Final review ticket: m-1ddc (approved, solid rating)
Adversarial ticket: m-c797 (verified, 7/7 exit criteria PASS)

Key files to review:
- docs/src/atoms/security/*.md (5 atoms)
- llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/main.mld (demo)
- interpreter/hooks/guard-post-hook.ts (categorical fix)

Assess whether polish gaps exist and whether the experience earns 'delightful' or just 'works correctly'.
