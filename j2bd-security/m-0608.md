# Assess security doc coverage vs spec v4

Map the spec-security-2026-v4.md sections to existing documentation atoms and identify gaps.

Spec sections to assess:
1. Part 1: Labels (The Foundation) - Check labels-overview.md, labels-source-auto.md, labels-sensitivity.md, label-tracking.md, automatic-labels.md
2. Part 2: Capability Enforcement - Check needs-declaration.md
3. Part 3: Policy (Declarative Controls) - Check policies.md
4. Part 4: Guards (Expressive Controls) - Check guards-basics.md, before-guards.md, after-guards.md, guard-composition.md, transform-with-allow.md, denied-handlers.md
5. Part 5: Environments - Check if covered
6. Part 6: MCP Integration - Check if covered
7. Part 7: Environment Providers - Check if covered
8. Part 8: Composition - Check if covered
9. Part 9: Denial Messages - Check denied-handlers.md
10. Part 10: Standard Policies - Check if covered
11. Part 11: Configuration - Check if covered
12. Part 14: Signing & Verification - Check if covered
13. Part 15: Audit Ledger - Check if covered

Deliverables:
- List of existing docs with brief summary of what they cover
- List of spec sections without adequate documentation
- Recommended order for filling gaps (prioritize foundational concepts)
