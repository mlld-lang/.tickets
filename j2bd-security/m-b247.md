# URGENT: Merge failed - Rebase conflicts in security documentation files

Merge of j2bd-security-2026-02-01-0 to j2bd/security failed.

**Issue**: Rebase conflicts in security documentation files

**Details**:
Rebase failed with add/add conflicts in:
- docs/src/atoms/security/autosign-autoverify.md
- docs/src/atoms/security/sign-verify.md

Both branches independently created these security documentation files with different content. The target branch (j2bd/security) has 293 commits ahead of the source branch.

Target branch version: Simpler content added in commit 732e6cf27 and updated in 7debd679a
Source branch version: More detailed content added in commit b8df869f7

The files contain different levels of detail and structure:
- Source has 188 lines with detailed examples, tables, and usage patterns
- Target has shorter, more concise content

Both versions appear to document the same autosign/autoverify features but with different approaches to documentation.

**Suggested action**: Manual merge required. Review both versions and decide whether to:
1. Keep the more detailed source branch version
2. Keep the simpler target branch version
3. Merge content from both versions

Recommended approach:
1. Create a manual merge worktree or branch
2. Examine both file versions carefully
3. Decide on documentation style (detailed vs concise)
4. Manually resolve conflicts preserving the best content from both
5. Test documentation build after resolution
6. Complete merge with resolved files
