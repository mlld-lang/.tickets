# Doc: labels-influenced atom

Write documentation atom explaining the `influenced` label.

## Context
From the security spec (Part 1.8): When untrusted data is in an LLM's context and the LLM produces output, that output receives the `influenced` label. This tracks that the LLM's decision-making was potentially affected by untrusted input.

## Key Points to Cover
- What the `influenced` label means
- How it's auto-applied when LLM processes untrusted data
- How it propagates through subsequent operations
- Policy rule `untrusted-llms-get-influenced` that enables this
- Why this matters for security (defense against prompt injection)

## Example Code (from spec)
```mlld
exe llm @processTask(task) = run cmd { claude -p "@task" }

// If @task contains untrusted data:
// 1. LLM processes the task
// 2. LLM output gets: influenced label
// 3. influenced propagates through subsequent operations
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Atom explains what `influenced` label means
- [ ] Shows how to enable via `defaults.rules`
- [ ] Includes working mlld example
- [ ] Validates with `mlld validate`
