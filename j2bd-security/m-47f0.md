# Final review: security documentation job

## Final Review

All 4 exit criteria verified by adversarial testing (m-7ef6):
1. Secret blocking - PASS: Label 'secret' cannot flow to 'exfil'
2. MCP blocking - PASS: Policy configuration correct
3. PII redaction - PASS: Guard redacts for show/log
4. Clear errors - PASS: Detailed denial with suggestions

## Review Scope

Starting commit: ee9a61f07d6d61712e7f676277d9710ff4605afd
Current HEAD: 8ce5f1ecd

Diff command: `git diff ee9a61f0..HEAD`

## Artifacts to Review

### Documentation (Atoms)
- docs/src/atoms/labels-sensitivity.md
- docs/src/atoms/labels-source-auto.md  
- docs/src/atoms/policy-label-flow.md
- docs/src/atoms/guards-basics.md

### Demo Files
- docs/src/atoms/security/examples/protection-1-secret.mld
- docs/src/atoms/security/examples/protection-2-mcp.mld
- docs/src/atoms/security/examples/protection-3-pii.mld
- docs/src/atoms/security/examples/protection-4-errors.mld

### Known Gaps (Documented, Outside Criteria)
1. protection-1-secret.mld only blocks network calls, not file writes (criterion says 'network calls')
2. protection-3-pii.mld guard only covers show/log, not file output (criterion says 'logged/displayed')

## Rating Criteria (High Polish)

- broken: Fundamental issues, doesn't work
- narrow: Works but fixes are specific rather than categorical
- adequate: Works correctly with minor gaps
- solid: Comprehensive, well-documented, handles edge cases
- excellent: Delightful UX, anticipates user needs

High polish requires 'solid' or better rating.
