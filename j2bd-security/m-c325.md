# Phase 5: Final review of reusable environment module job

Final holistic review of ALL work produced by the environment module J2BD job.

Starting commit (merge-base with main): ee9a61f07

Key deliverables to review:
1. pipeline/env-module/index.mld - Reusable module with profiles (full/readonly), policy.auth for keychain credential flow, @spawn/@shell exe definitions using auth:claude, and export
2. pipeline/env-module-demo.mld - Consumer script that imports @spawn and demonstrates usage
3. docs/src/atoms/security/env-overview.md - What environments are
4. docs/src/atoms/security/env-config.md - Environment configuration syntax
5. docs/src/atoms/security/policy-auth.md - Credential management via policy.auth
6. docs/src/atoms/security/policy-composition.md - Combining policies and profiles
7. docs/src/atoms/modules/exporting.md - Module export syntax (pre-existing, updated 2026-01-05)

Adversarial verification passed 5/5 exit criteria and 8/8 additional tests.

Review should assess:
- Do the atoms accurately describe what the implementation does?
- Is the module a good demonstration of the sharing workflow?
- Are there any systemic issues with the implementation?
- Does the documentation promise match implementation reality?
- Would a user following these docs successfully create and share a reusable environment module?
