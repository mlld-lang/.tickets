# Fix reserved @input variable in pattern-audit-guard.md

Excellence assessment found pattern-audit-guard.md uses reserved variable name `@input` which causes the capstone example to fail.

**Error when running:**
```
Error: Cannot create variable '@input': this name is already reserved by the system or a resolver prefix
```

**Fix required:**
1. Line 41: Change `var untrusted @input = ...` to `var untrusted @externalInput = ...`
2. Line 44: Change `@process(@input)` to `@process(@externalInput)`

**Verification:**
After fix, run `npx mlld docs/src/atoms/security/pattern-audit-guard.md` (or copy example to tmp file) and confirm it runs without error.

**File:** docs/src/atoms/security/pattern-audit-guard.md


**2026-02-04 23:45 UTC:** Fix applied directly by decision agent (2-line change). Code validated successfully.
