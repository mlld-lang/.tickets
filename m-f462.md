# Add mlld example CLI command

Create a 'mlld example <name>' CLI command that shows complete working examples. Move plugins/mlld/examples/ to docs/src/examples/ so examples are accessible via CLI, website, and plugin skills. Command behavior: no args lists available examples with descriptions, name arg shows README + key file content for that example. Current examples in plugins/mlld/examples/: audit, development, research, event-agent, tool-agent, workflow-agent. Each has index.mld, prompt templates, lib modules. Update plugins/mlld/ skills to reference 'mlld example <name>' instead of embedding code. This makes examples testable, discoverable, and DRY.
