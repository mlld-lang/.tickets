# Plugin: mlld security

Create plugins/security — a Claude Code plugin for applying mlld's prompt injection defense strategies.

Context: This is the third of three planned mlld plugins. The first (plugins/orchestrate) teaches orchestrator authoring. The second (plugins/agents) covers agent patterns.

plugins/security should cover:
- mlld's guard system for data flow control (taint tracking, influence labels)
- Signed instruction patterns (autosign/autoverify) for prompt injection defense
- The untrusted data annotation system (var untrusted @x = ...)
- Audit patterns that use guards to detect injection in LLM outputs
- Environment-level security: credential sealing, filesystem restrictions, network isolation
- Working examples of defense-in-depth patterns
- How security patterns compose with orchestrators and agents

Reference: plugins/orchestrate for structure conventions
Reference: llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/main.mld for audit guard pattern
Reference: llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/sandbox-demo.mld for environment sandboxing
