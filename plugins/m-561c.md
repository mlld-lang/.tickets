# Plugin: mlld agents

Create plugins/agents — a Claude Code plugin for using mlld to create autonomous agents.

Context: This is the second of three planned mlld plugins. The first (plugins/orchestrate) teaches orchestrator authoring with decision loops, adversarial invalidation, and the three archetypes (audit, research, development).

plugins/agents should cover:
- Agent definition patterns in mlld (capabilities, tool restrictions, sandboxing)
- The relationship between agents and orchestrators (agents are workers dispatched BY orchestrators)
- Agent-specific patterns: tool permission scoping, credential sealing, environment isolation
- Working examples of different agent configurations
- How mlld's guard system constrains agent behavior

Reference: plugins/orchestrate for structure conventions (skills, examples, .lsp.json, .mcp.json)
Reference: llm/run/j2bd/security/impl/ for agent sandboxing patterns
