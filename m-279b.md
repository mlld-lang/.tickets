# Fix guard-composition.md and denied-handlers.md: remove label-entry guard references

Two docs reference the wrong 'label-entry guard' framing and need updates.

**guard-composition.md:**
- Line 14: 'These rules apply to operation guards (before op:TYPE, after op:TYPE)' — with unified matching, bare-label guards also participate in operation-phase composition when matched via operation keys
- Line 26: 'Label-entry guards (before LABEL) fire independently per labeled value and do not participate in operation-phase composition' — needs nuance: per-input guards fire per-input but DO participate in the same deny/allow/retry decision pipeline

**denied-handlers.md:**
- Line 31: 'Label-entry guards (before LABEL) fire at data creation time before any operation context exists, so denied handlers do not apply to them' — wrong premise. Need to clarify actual denied handler applicability rules without the false 'creation time' claim.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- No references to 'label-entry guards' as a separate category
- guard-composition.md explains how per-input and per-operation guards compose together
- denied-handlers.md correctly describes when denied handlers apply and why
