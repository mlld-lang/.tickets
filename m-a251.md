# Add mlld -e for inline code execution

## Feature Request

Add `mlld -e '<code>'` for quick one-liner execution, similar to `node -e`, `python -c`, `ruby -e`.

## Use Case

When debugging or testing small snippets:

```bash
mlld -e 'var @x = "test" | @json; show @x'
mlld -e 'show @now'
mlld -e 'var @files = <src/*.ts>; show @files.length'
```

## Current Workaround

Create temp file, run it, delete it:

```bash
echo 'show @now' > /tmp/test.mld && mlld /tmp/test.mld
```

## Impact

Significant friction during development and debugging.
