# Better error for var inside blocks

Using `var` inside blocks gives confusing error:

```
Expected if action block body but "v" found.
```

Applies to all block types: if, when, for. Any context where `var` appears inside `[...]` should produce this error.

Error message: `` `var` cannot be used inside blocks — use `let` for block-scoped bindings ``
