# Revisit patterns reference page

Patterns category was removed from the website because most pattern atoms are outdated or wrong. The prose atom was moved to Language Reference. When ready, audit the remaining pattern atoms (tool-orchestration, data-pipelines, conditional-workflows, guarded-execution, guarded-tool-export, router, gate, parallel-execution, llm-integration, agent-definition, ralph) for accuracy and add back as a reference page.
