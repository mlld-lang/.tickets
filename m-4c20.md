# Method chaining on function call results fails at runtime in simple exe

Method chaining on function call results in simple exe definitions validates but fails at runtime.

**Reproduction:**
```mlld
exe @getStr() = "hello world"
exe @checkHello() = @getStr().includes("hello")
var @result = @checkHello()
show @result
```

**Expected:** Outputs `true`

**Actual:** 
```
MlldInterpreter: Interpreter error (undefined): Referenced command not found: includes
```

**Note:** `mlld validate` passes - the syntax is valid, but the interpreter doesn't handle method calls on function results in simple exe definitions.

**Workaround:** Use block with intermediate variable:
```mlld
exe @checkHello() = [
  let @str = @getStr()
  => @str.includes("hello")
]
```
