# mlld validate should catch reserved variable name conflicts

Using `let @exists = ...` inside an exe block causes a runtime error: 'Variable exists is already defined and cannot be redefined'. But `mlld validate` passes clean with no warning.

This cost significant debugging time in a pipeline where the error was silently swallowed (see companion ticket).

Expected: `mlld validate` catches reserved/built-in name collisions at validation time with a clear message like 'Cannot redefine built-in @exists — use a different variable name'.

Additionally, `@exists` is not listed in the reserved-variables howto docs (only @now, @input, @payload, @state, @base, @debug, @fm are listed). All reserved names should be documented.

Repro:
```mlld
exe @test() = [
  let @exists = "hello"
  => @exists
]
var @r = @test()
```
Passes validate, fails at runtime.


**2026-02-12 12:58 UTC:** Implemented validate-time built-in conflict detection for let/var declarations with explicit reason=builtin-conflict and actionable suggestion. This catches @exists and similar collisions before runtime. Added coverage in cli/commands/analyze.test.ts. Full npm test passes.
