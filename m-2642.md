# Create or update the security implementation artifact to demonstrate built-in rules with the two-step pattern. The demo must show: (1) Policy with defaults.rules listing no-secret-exfil, no-untrusted-destructive, etc. (2) policy.operations mapping semantic labels to risk categories. (3) exe functions with SEMANTIC labels (exe net:w, exe fs:w) NOT direct risk labels. (4) var secret data blocked from flowing to exfil-classified operations. (5) var untrusted data blocked from flowing to destructive-classified operations. (6) Normal (unlabeled, trusted) data flowing freely through both operation types.
