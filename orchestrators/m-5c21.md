# Generalize review pipeline to config-driven

## Problem

llm/run/review/ is hardcoded to review hooks/checkpoints/resume. The 6-phase pipeline structure is generic but the review targets and reference doc paths are feature-specific.

## Work

1. Refactor index.mld to load config from --config payload
2. Create example-config.mld extracting current hardcoded data
3. Update 5 prompt templates to parameterize reference docs (refDocsSection + ticketContext instead of specPath/planPath)
4. Support any combination of: spec file, plan file, ticket IDs/directory
5. Create README.md with usage instructions
6. Use @lib/ shared libraries

Approved plan at: .claude/plans/binary-jingling-petal.md

Usage: mlld run review --config path/to/config.mld [--parallel 5] [--phase 1-6]
