# Rewrite intro.md atom

Rewrite docs/src/atoms/intro.md to better describe mlld: (a) surgical context assembly, (b) token-efficient logic-focused orchestrators mixing shell/js/python/prompts, (c) secure agent workflows defending against prompt injection. Incorporate security spec summary and gotchas section.


**2026-02-15 20:48 UTC:** Rewrote intro.md emphasizing three purposes: surgical context assembly, token-efficient orchestration, secure agent workflows. Integrated security philosophy (consequences not intentions). Added inline gotchas with most common traps. Validates successfully.
