# @base should resolve to script directory, not CWD

@base currently resolves to CWD, which breaks the natural mental model that paths are relative to the script. This causes:

1. CLI args with relative paths fail silently — resolve relative to CWD not script location
2. Multiple scripts sharing CWD write to the same runs/ directory, causing cross-contamination
3. File loads with CLI-provided paths resolve unexpectedly

Desired state: @base resolves to the directory containing the running script. If a @cwd builtin is needed for the current behavior, add that separately. Script-relative is the correct default.
