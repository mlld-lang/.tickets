# Duplicate error emitted for missing file imports

## Current behavior

```mlld
import { @helper } from "./nonexistent.mld"
```

Prints the "file not found" error message twice — the same error text appears in the console output two times.

## Fix

Find the import error path (likely in `interpreter/eval/import/` or `ImportResolver.ts`) and ensure the error is only emitted once. One of the two emission points should be removed — the error is probably being thrown and also explicitly logged before the throw.
