# Reserved variable names not documented — 'exists' and 'upper' collide silently

## Summary

Variable names like `@exists` and `@upper` throw "Variable 'X' is already defined" even on first use, because they collide with undocumented built-in names. The reserved name list is not documented or discoverable.

## Repro

```mlld
var @items = ["a", "b"]
var @results = for @item in @items [
  let @exists = "yes"
  => @exists
]
```

**Error:** `Variable 'exists' is already defined and cannot be redefined`

This happens on the very first use of `let @exists` — there is no prior definition in user code. The name collides with a built-in.

Same with `@upper`:
```mlld
let @upper = "HELLO"
>> Error: Variable 'upper' is already defined
```

## Impact

Medium-high. Common English words are reserved without documentation. Users discover collisions only at runtime with an error message that says "already defined" — implying they defined it twice, when they never defined it at all.

## Expected Behavior

Either:
1. Document the full list of reserved variable names (preferred)
2. Improve the error message: "Variable 'exists' conflicts with built-in 'exists'" instead of "is already defined"
3. Both

## Workaround

Use different names: `@fileCheck` instead of `@exists`, `@uppercased` instead of `@upper`.
