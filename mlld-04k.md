# Docs: alternative syntax guide

Document alternative syntax forms in a new docs/user/alternative-syntax.md. Cover:\n- Backtick + @var templates and .att template file style as primary patterns.\n- Alternative cases for markdown mode templates and other interpolation styles.\n- Guidance on when to use markdown mode vs strict.\n- Cross-link from main docs without promoting alternates as defaults.
