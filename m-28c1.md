# needs py check uses pip instead of pip3

The dependency checker in interpreter/eval/dependencies.ts uses 'pip show' to check Python packages. On macOS (and many Linux distros), only 'pip3' exists — 'pip' is not found. This causes all needs { py: [...] } checks to fail with 'Missing packages' even when the packages are installed. Should try pip3 first, fall back to pip.
