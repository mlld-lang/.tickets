# Bare function call gives misleading error in strict mode

Writing @save('dir', 'world') at top level in a .mld file gives 'Text content not allowed in strict mode (.mld). Use .mld.md for prose.' The error doesn't hint that you need 'run @save(...)' for side-effect-only function calls. Should either:
- Detect the pattern and suggest 'run @functionName(...)' 
- Or mention that executable calls at top level need the 'run' prefix
