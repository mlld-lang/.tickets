# Add bail/exit directive for early script termination

No way to exit a script early at module level. Inside loops use `done`, but at module level there's no equivalent. Use case: validation checks at startup that should abort if prerequisites aren't met. Proposed: `bail` directive that terminates with error message and non-zero exit code.
