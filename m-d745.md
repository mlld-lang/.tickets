# CLI: --dry-run parsed incorrectly as separate @dry and @run variables

Kebab-case CLI arguments like --dry-run are parsed as two separate variables (@dry, @run) instead of a single camelCase variable (@dryRun). This causes parse errors when importing @payload. Workaround: use --dryRun=true explicitly.
