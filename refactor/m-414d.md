# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/for.ts - Phase 7: Final composition cleanup and semantic verification



Objective:
Reduce `for.ts` to orchestration and verify semantics remain stable.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Refactor exported directive/expression evaluators to compose extracted modules with minimal inline branching.
- Remove duplicate helper code and verify dependency direction remains acyclic.
- Attach architecture notes documenting shared runner boundaries and directive/expression specialization points.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
