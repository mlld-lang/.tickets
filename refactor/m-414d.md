# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/for.ts - Phase 7: Final composition cleanup and semantic verification



Objective:
Reduce `for.ts` to orchestration and verify semantics remain stable.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Refactor exported directive/expression evaluators to compose extracted modules with minimal inline branching.
- Remove duplicate helper code and verify dependency direction remains acyclic.
- Attach architecture notes documenting shared runner boundaries and directive/expression specialization points.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 20:42 UTC:** Phase 7 completion evidence (final composition cleanup + semantic verification)

Touched runtime modules (ownership + line counts):
- interpreter/eval/for.ts (265 LOC): retained orchestration for directive/expression execution flow and iteration scheduling; removed inline source-validation and result-variable assembly logic.
- interpreter/eval/for/source-evaluator.ts (102 LOC, new): owns source evaluation, iterable validation/type-mismatch error construction, and expression-source descriptor fallback resolution.
- interpreter/eval/for/result-variable.ts (168 LOC, new): owns final for-expression variable construction (metadata, descriptor merge, provenance propagation, and type-specific variable creation).
- interpreter/eval/for/directive-action-runner.ts (214 LOC): imports shared control-kind resolver type from for/types.
- interpreter/eval/for/expression-runner.ts (236 LOC): imports shared control-kind resolver type from for/types.

Touched type-only module:
- interpreter/eval/for/types.ts (9 LOC): shared ForControlKindResolver type + ForIterationError.

Guardrail checks:
- No new runtime module under 60 LOC introduced (new runtime modules are 102 LOC and 168 LOC).
- No callback-lambda service injection introduced.
- Duplicated source mismatch/preview logic is centralized in source-evaluator.ts.
- Duplicated result-variable assembly and descriptor propagation logic is centralized in result-variable.ts.

Acyclic dependency verification (local for-evaluator graph):
- Command: node local graph DFS over interpreter/eval/for.ts + interpreter/eval/for/*.ts imports
- Result: NO_CYCLES

Targeted tests (pass):
- npx vitest run interpreter/eval/for/error-reporting.test.ts interpreter/eval/for.characterization.test.ts interpreter/eval/for-expression-mx.test.ts interpreter/eval/for-expression-when.test.ts interpreter/eval/for-nested-empty.test.ts tests/for/key-binding.test.ts tests/for/parallel-runtime.test.ts tests/for/rate-limit-retry.test.ts tests/integration/for-expr-error-propagation.test.ts tests/parallel/shell-commands-parallel.test.ts
- Result: Test Files 10 passed; Tests 40 passed.

Full gate (pass):
- npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
- Result: command chain exited 0.
  - npm test: Test Files 358 passed | 7 skipped; Tests 3920 passed | 63 skipped.
  - npm run test:tokens: Test Files 6 passed; Tests 331 passed | 6 skipped.
  - npm run test:examples: Test Files 1 passed; Tests 1353 passed | 2 skipped.
