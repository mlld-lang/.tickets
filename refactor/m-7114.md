# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/show.ts - Phase 2: Extract show-variable resolution pipeline



Objective:
Modularize variable-based show handling.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract showVariable handler covering type-specific value extraction, template interpolation, field access, and unified pipeline tail handling.
- Preserve namespace display behavior and structured-value formatting behavior.
- Add tests for variable field access, template variables, pipeline tails, and namespace display output.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
