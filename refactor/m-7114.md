# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/show.ts - Phase 2: Extract show-variable resolution pipeline



Objective:
Modularize variable-based show handling.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract showVariable handler covering type-specific value extraction, template interpolation, field access, and unified pipeline tail handling.
- Preserve namespace display behavior and structured-value formatting behavior.
- Add tests for variable field access, template variables, pipeline tails, and namespace display output.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 18:03 UTC:** --dir refactor Implemented phase 2 extraction for show-variable resolution pipeline.

Touched runtime modules:
- interpreter/eval/show/show-variable.ts (548 LOC): extracted showVariable handling including variable-node resolution (legacy + unified), template interpolation, field access, namespace formatting path, legacy/unified tail pipeline handling, and extracted-input lookup.
- interpreter/eval/show.ts (898 LOC): delegated showVariable subtype to show-variable module while keeping directive orchestration and downstream output contract.
- interpreter/eval/show/shared-helpers.ts (218 LOC): reused phase-1 descriptor/policy/output helpers unchanged for showVariable delegation.

Tests added/updated:
- interpreter/eval/show.characterization.test.ts: added template-variable pipeline and namespace display characterization coverage.

Targeted checks:
- npm run build ✅
- npx vitest run interpreter/eval/show/shared-helpers.test.ts interpreter/eval/show.characterization.test.ts interpreter/eval/show.structured.test.ts ✅

Phase full gate:
- npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples ✅

Guardrail attestations:
- No new runtime module under 60 LOC (new runtime module is 548 LOC).
- No callback-lambda service injection introduced; module composes directly via explicit parameters and shared service object.
- No duplicated showVariable logic across sibling modules; branch logic moved wholesale into a single ownership module.
