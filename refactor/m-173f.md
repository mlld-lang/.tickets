# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/when.ts - Phase 2: Extract action sequence executor and control propagation



Objective:
Modularize action-sequence execution used across when handlers.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract `evaluateActionSequence` and related control propagation logic into a reusable action runner module.
- Preserve behavior for let/augmented statements intermixed with directive/expression actions.
- Add tests for execution ordering and early return control behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
