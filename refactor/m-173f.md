# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/when.ts - Phase 2: Extract action sequence executor and control propagation



Objective:
Modularize action-sequence execution used across when handlers.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract `evaluateActionSequence` and related control propagation logic into a reusable action runner module.
- Preserve behavior for let/augmented statements intermixed with directive/expression actions.
- Add tests for execution ordering and early return control behavior.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 15:51 UTC:** Phase 2 complete: extracted action-sequence execution and control propagation into dedicated runner module.\n\nRuntime modules touched:\n- interpreter/eval/when/action-runner.ts (94 LOC): owns ordered action execution, let/+= assignment dispatch, and exe-return control short-circuit behavior.\n- interpreter/eval/when.ts (1252 LOC): now consumes action-runner service while preserving behavior and public exports.\n\nTest modules touched:\n- interpreter/eval/when.characterization.test.ts (465 LOC): added mixed action-sequence ordering characterization (let + += + directive tail) and kept return-control characterization.\n\nTargeted checks:\n- npm run build && npm test -- interpreter/eval/when.characterization.test.ts interpreter/eval/when.test.ts (pass)\n\nFull gate evidence:\n- npm run build && npm test -- interpreter/eval/when.characterization.test.ts interpreter/eval/when.test.ts (pass; suite green)\n- npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples (pass)\n\nGuardrail confirmations:\n- No new sub-60 runtime module introduced (new runtime module is 94 LOC).\n- No callback-lambda service injection introduced.
