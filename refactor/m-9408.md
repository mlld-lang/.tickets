# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/show.ts - Phase 5: Extract foreach and foreach-section handlers



Objective:
Separate foreach-oriented display handlers.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract add/show foreach handlers, foreach section evaluation, and with-clause option extraction helpers.
- Preserve option defaults and output joining semantics.
- Add tests for foreach output formatting and foreach-section rendering behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
