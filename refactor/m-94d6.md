# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/when.ts - Phase 3: Extract when form handlers and dispatch orchestration



Objective:
Separate simple/match/block orchestration from shared matching engines.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract `evaluateWhenSimple`, `evaluateWhenMatch`, and `evaluateWhenBlock` into dedicated form handlers.
- Keep child-environment merge behavior and output suppression semantics unchanged.
- Add tests for per-form behavior and environment merge correctness.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
