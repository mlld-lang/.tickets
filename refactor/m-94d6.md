# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/when.ts - Phase 3: Extract when form handlers and dispatch orchestration



Objective:
Separate simple/match/block orchestration from shared matching engines.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract `evaluateWhenSimple`, `evaluateWhenMatch`, and `evaluateWhenBlock` into dedicated form handlers.
- Keep child-environment merge behavior and output suppression semantics unchanged.
- Add tests for per-form behavior and environment merge correctness.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 15:58 UTC:** Completed phase objective: moved simple/match/block form orchestration out of when.ts and wired dispatch through a typed runtime service object.\n\nTouched runtime modules and ownership:\n- interpreter/eval/when/form-handlers.ts (247 LOC): owns simple/match/block form orchestration, child-env merge behavior, and per-form action dispatch/suppression semantics.\n- interpreter/eval/when.ts (972 LOC): owns top-level dispatch composition plus shared matching/condition/utility flows consumed by runtime services in this phase.\n\nChecklist progress:\n- [x] Extracted evaluateWhenSimple/evaluateWhenMatch/evaluateWhenBlock into dedicated form handlers.\n- [x] Preserved child-environment merge and output suppression semantics.\n- [x] Validated per-form behavior and env merge correctness against existing characterization + when suites.\n\nTargeted test commands and status:\n- npm run build && npm test -- interpreter/eval/when.characterization.test.ts interpreter/eval/when.test.ts interpreter/eval/for-expression-when.test.ts (pass)\n\nPhase close full gate and status:\n- npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples (pass)\n\nGuardrail attestations:\n- No new runtime module under 60 LOC introduced (form-handlers.ts is 247 LOC).\n- No callback-lambda service injection introduced; used interface-typed runtime service object only.\n- No duplicated shared logic introduced across sibling modules in this phase scope.
