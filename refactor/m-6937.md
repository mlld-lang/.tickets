# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.ts



Largest unplanned target file: `interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.ts` (~1,429 LOC).

This epic coordinates a phased refactor that decomposes AST extraction into focused modules while preserving pattern semantics, language extractor behavior, and output ordering guarantees.

Execution order:
1. Phase 0 through Phase 7 proceed strictly in order.
2. Each phase closes only after its exit criteria are met.
3. No phase starts until its dependency ticket is closed.

Cross-phase constraints:
- Keep exported APIs stable: `extractAst`, `extractNames`, and exported pattern helpers.
- Preserve matching semantics for wildcard/exact patterns, usage patterns, type filters, and null placeholders.
- Preserve extractor behavior and ordering for all supported languages.
- Preserve dedupe/containment pruning logic in result assembly.
- Keep performance characteristics acceptable for large source files.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase tickets (0-7) exist under this epic and are dependency-linked in sequence.
2. Each phase ticket includes explicit implementation instructions and explicit exit criteria.
3. Final structure splits responsibilities into cohesive modules under `interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/` (or equivalent) and reduces `ast-extractor.ts` to orchestration/registry glue.
4. Final validation command passes with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
