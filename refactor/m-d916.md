# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.ts - Phase 4: Extract Rust and Go extractor modules



Objective:
Modularize Rust/Go extractor implementations.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Move Rust and Go extraction logic into dedicated modules while preserving function/method/type detection behavior.
- Keep block-end computation behavior and top-level filtering semantics unchanged.
- Add tests for Rust impl methods and Go receiver methods/type extraction cases.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
