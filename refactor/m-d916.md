# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.ts - Phase 4: Extract Rust and Go extractor modules



Objective:
Modularize Rust/Go extractor implementations.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Move Rust and Go extraction logic into dedicated modules while preserving function/method/type detection behavior.
- Keep block-end computation behavior and top-level filtering semantics unchanged.
- Add tests for Rust impl methods and Go receiver methods/type extraction cases.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 19:04 UTC:** --dir refactor Completed phase-4 extraction for Rust/Go definition logic. Runtime modules touched: interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/rust-extractor.ts (85 lines, owns Rust top-level fn/struct/enum/trait/const extraction and impl method extraction), interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/go-extractor.ts (79 lines, owns Go receiver/function/type/var extraction and type classification), interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/shared-utils.ts (98 lines, owns shared definition slicing helpers createBlockDefinition/createLineDefinition and block-body search extraction used by extracted modules), interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.ts (643 lines, orchestrator/registry wiring updated to import extracted Rust/Go modules and keep remaining language extractors). Added phase-specific tests: interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/language-group-b.test.ts (Rust impl methods and Go receiver/type extraction coverage). Targeted checks passed: npm run build && npx vitest run interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/language-group-b.test.ts interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/language-group-a.test.ts interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.characterization.test.ts interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/language-dispatch.test.ts interpreter/eval/content-loader-ast.test.ts interpreter/eval/alligator.structured.test.ts. Full gate passed: npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples. No new sub-60 runtime modules introduced. No callback-lambda service injection introduced.
