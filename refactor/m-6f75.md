# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.ts - Phase 2: Extract language dispatch and shared definition helpers



Objective:
Separate dispatch and shared parsing helpers from extractors.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract extension-based language dispatcher and shared helpers (`getLinesAndOffsets`, shared block-end utilities where applicable).
- Preserve fallback behavior and extension mapping for all supported file types.
- Add tests for dispatcher behavior across supported extension sets.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
