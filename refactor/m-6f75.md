# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.ts - Phase 2: Extract language dispatch and shared definition helpers



Objective:
Separate dispatch and shared parsing helpers from extractors.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract extension-based language dispatcher and shared helpers (`getLinesAndOffsets`, shared block-end utilities where applicable).
- Preserve fallback behavior and extension mapping for all supported file types.
- Add tests for dispatcher behavior across supported extension sets.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 18:53 UTC:** --dir refactor Completed language dispatch and shared definition helper extraction for ast-extractor. Added interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/language-dispatch.ts with extension->extractor routing + extractDefinitionsForFile(), added interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/shared-utils.ts for getLinesAndOffsets() and findBraceBlockEnd(), and rewired interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.ts to use centralized dispatch and shared helpers across extractAst/extractNames and extractor implementations. Added language-dispatch tests in interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/language-dispatch.test.ts and kept characterization/content-loader/alligator tests green. Full gate passed: npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples.
