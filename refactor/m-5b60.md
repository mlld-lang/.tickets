# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/import/ImportDirectiveEvaluator.ts - Phase 5: Extract file, URL, and directory import handlers



Objective:
Isolate filesystem/network import orchestration.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- In scope: file/url import handlers and directory traversal/option parsing/skip logic extraction.
- Out of scope: module/node/resolver/MCP handler extraction.
- Extract file/url import handling and directory import traversal (`maybeProcessDirectoryImport`, option parsing, skip logic) into dedicated handlers.
- Preserve directory key sanitization, duplicate-key detection, and index discovery behavior.
- Add tests for directory `skipDirs`, empty-directory failure, and mixed file/directory path behavior.

Module boundaries:
- File/url handler module owns single-source import processing.
- Directory handler module owns traversal, option parsing, key generation, and duplicate detection.
- Top-level evaluator routes source types without embedding traversal logic.

Preserve behavior checks:
- File/url parsing and import behavior remain unchanged.
- Directory `skipDirs`, key sanitization, duplicate-key detection, and index discovery remain unchanged.
- Empty-directory and mixed path failure semantics remain unchanged.

Micro-checklist (directory traversal risk matrix):
- Add directory traversal cases combining nested dirs, `skipDirs`, and index discovery with deterministic ordering assertions.
- Add mixed module-like/file-like naming cases to assert unchanged key sanitization and duplicate-key detection.
- Add collision-triggering directory imports and assert unchanged error payloads.
- Add empty-directory and optional-import combinations to assert unchanged failure/skip behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. File/url/directory import logic is extracted into focused handlers.
2. Traversal, duplicate detection, and failure behavior remain baseline-compatible.
3. Tests cover skip rules, empty-directory failures, and mixed path cases.
4. Every item in the micro-checklist is backed by explicit tests before closing this phase.
5. Exit criteria: test gate command succeeds and output is attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
