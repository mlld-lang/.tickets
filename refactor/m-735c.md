# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/hooks/guard-post-hook.ts - Phase 2: Extract descriptor and output normalization services



Objective:
Isolate output/descriptor shaping logic used across guard decisions.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- In scope: output normalization, descriptor extraction/merge/apply, replacement normalization.
- Out of scope: decision loop orchestration and retry error signal construction.
- Extract raw output normalization, output descriptor extraction, descriptor merge/apply helpers, and replacement normalization.
- Preserve structured value handling and descriptor application semantics for transformed outputs.
- Add tests for descriptor merge behavior across output/input fallback and replacement paths.

Module boundaries:
- Descriptor module owns descriptor extraction/merge/apply behavior.
- Output normalization module owns raw/transformed output shaping.
- Decision engine consumes normalized outputs and descriptors.

Preserve behavior checks:
- Descriptor propagation and label modifications remain unchanged.
- Structured value output handling remains unchanged.
- Replacement-path descriptor semantics remain unchanged.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Descriptor/output normalization logic is extracted into focused modules.
2. Descriptor merge/apply and replacement normalization behavior remain baseline-compatible.
3. Tests cover descriptor propagation across fallback and replacement paths.
4. Exit criteria: test gate command succeeds and output is attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
