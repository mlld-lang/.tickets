# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.ts - Phase 0: Baseline and characterization



Objective:
Establish baseline extraction behavior across pattern modes and languages.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Map responsibilities across pattern matching, sequence assembly, and per-language extractors.
- Add characterization tests for wildcard patterns, usage patterns, type filters, null placeholders, and output ordering.
- Capture extraction seams and regression risks; do not move code across files in this phase.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
