# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/for.ts - Phase 4: Extract directive action execution handler



Objective:
Isolate directive-specific action execution and side-effect behavior.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract directive action evaluation logic (block vs non-block, let/augmented handling, retry handling, effect emission for bare exec invocations).
- Preserve current behavior for parallel mutation constraints and forErrors accumulation.
- Add tests for directive action branch coverage and retry/error handling paths.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 20:20 UTC:** Extracted directive action execution into a dedicated runtime handler and wired evaluateForDirective to consume it.

Completed checklist items:
- Extracted directive action branch execution (block and non-block) into interpreter/eval/for/directive-action-runner.ts.
- Preserved block let/augmented assignment handling including parallel outer-mutation guard behavior.
- Preserved per-iteration rate-limit retry behavior with backoff in directive action execution.
- Preserved bare ExecInvocation effect emission behavior for non-block directive actions.
- Kept forErrors accumulation/formatting behavior in the for.ts orchestration layer.
- Added directive-focused characterization tests for non-block bare exec emission and block retry behavior.

Touched runtime modules:
- interpreter/eval/for/directive-action-runner.ts (215 LOC): directive block/non-block action execution, control handling, retry loop, bare exec emission.
- interpreter/eval/for.ts (675 LOC): directive iteration orchestration updated to call extracted runtime service.

Targeted verification:
- npm run build ✅
- npx vitest run interpreter/eval/for.characterization.test.ts interpreter/eval/for-expression-mx.test.ts interpreter/eval/for-expression-when.test.ts interpreter/eval/for-nested-empty.test.ts tests/for/key-binding.test.ts tests/for/parallel-runtime.test.ts tests/for/rate-limit-retry.test.ts tests/integration/for-expr-error-propagation.test.ts tests/parallel/shell-commands-parallel.test.ts ✅

Phase full gate:
- npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples ✅

Guardrail checks:
- No new sub-60 runtime module introduced.
- No callback-lambda service injection introduced.
- No duplicated directive action logic across sibling modules; branch execution is centralized in directive-action-runner.
- Dependency direction remains acyclic in interpreter/eval/for* (for.ts -> for/directive-action-runner.ts; no reverse import).
