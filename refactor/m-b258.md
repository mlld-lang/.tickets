# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/for.ts - Phase 4: Extract directive action execution handler



Objective:
Isolate directive-specific action execution and side-effect behavior.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract directive action evaluation logic (block vs non-block, let/augmented handling, retry handling, effect emission for bare exec invocations).
- Preserve current behavior for parallel mutation constraints and forErrors accumulation.
- Add tests for directive action branch coverage and retry/error handling paths.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
