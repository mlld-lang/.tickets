# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/exe.ts - Phase 3: Extract shadow environment declaration handling



Objective:
Isolate `@exec js|node|python = { ... }` environment wiring.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract environment declaration branch logic: wrapper creation, shadow env registration, python shadow function definition, and captured env propagation.
- Preserve function availability and mutual capture behavior across declared functions.
- Add tests for cross-function capture and language-specific wrapper behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
