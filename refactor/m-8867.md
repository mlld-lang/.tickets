# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/exe.ts - Phase 3: Extract shadow environment declaration handling



Objective:
Isolate `@exec js|node|python = { ... }` environment wiring.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract environment declaration branch logic: wrapper creation, shadow env registration, python shadow function definition, and captured env propagation.
- Preserve function availability and mutual capture behavior across declared functions.
- Add tests for cross-function capture and language-specific wrapper behavior.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 17:01 UTC:** Extracted environment declaration runtime into interpreter/eval/exe/environment-declaration.ts and delegated the environment subtype branch from interpreter/eval/exe.ts.

Touched runtime modules:
- interpreter/eval/exe/environment-declaration.ts (330 LOC): owns wrapper creation, shadow env registration, python shadow function definition, and captured-shadow-env propagation.
- interpreter/eval/exe.ts (794 LOC): owns evaluateExe orchestration and delegates environment subtype handling to the extracted runtime.

Phase checklist coverage:
- Extracted environment declaration branch logic.
- Preserved cross-function capture behavior and language-specific registration behavior.
- Added characterization coverage in interpreter/eval/exe.characterization.test.ts for shared JS cross-function capture and python shadow registration.

Validation:
- npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples (PASS)

Guardrails:
- No new runtime module under 60 LOC was introduced.
- No callback-lambda service injection was introduced.
- Dependency direction in interpreter/eval/exe* remains acyclic for touched modules.
