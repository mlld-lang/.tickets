# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.ts - Phase 1: Extract pattern matcher and sequence orchestration core



Objective:
Isolate pattern evaluation and result assembly logic.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract wildcard/exact matching helpers, type-filter checks, and sequence/dedupe/containment orchestration into a pattern core module.
- Preserve sequence output behavior including null placeholders and containment pruning.
- Add tests for sequence stability and duplicate suppression behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
