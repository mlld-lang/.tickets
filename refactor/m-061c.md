# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/show.ts - Phase 7: Final composition cleanup and effect contract verification



Objective:
Reduce `show.ts` to orchestration with stable behavior contracts.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Refactor `evaluateShow` to delegate to extracted subtype handlers with a thin dispatcher.
- Remove duplicated conversion logic and verify dependency graph remains acyclic.
- Attach architecture notes documenting handler boundaries and final output/effect pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
