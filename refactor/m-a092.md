# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor.ts - Phase 3: Extract command resolution and argument binding

Objective:
Modularize command-reference resolution, argument evaluation, and parameter binding logic.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract argument-processing logic (`processArguments`, argument-node evaluation, and auto-binding) into dedicated command invocation helpers.
- Extract command-reference resolution/execution wrapper logic into a cohesive collaborator.
- Keep lazy imports and wrapper-preservation semantics intact for pipeline inputs.
- Add tests that cover explicit args, auto-binding (single and multi-parameter), variable reference field access, and command label descriptor composition.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Command resolution and argument/binding responsibilities move out of `PipelineExecutor` into dedicated module(s).
2. Command invocation behavior remains stable across baseline scenarios.
3. Exit criteria: all tests pass with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 05:43 UTC:** --dir refactor

**2026-02-11 05:45 UTC:** --dir refactor

**2026-02-11 05:45 UTC:** Phase 3 extraction implemented.

Scope completed:
- Extracted argument evaluation/binding into `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/command-argument-binder.ts`.
- Extracted command resolution/execution wrapper + label descriptor composition into `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/command-invoker.ts`.
- Rewired `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor.ts` to delegate command invocation flow through new collaborators.
- Added focused tests:
  - `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/command-argument-binder.test.ts`
  - `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/command-invoker.test.ts`

Touched runtime modules + ownership:
- `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/command-argument-binder.ts` (105 LOC): explicit arg evaluation, variable field access arg resolution, automatic parameter binding.
- `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/command-invoker.ts` (76 LOC): command-reference resolution, command execution wrapper, command label descriptor composition.
- `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor.ts` (1286 LOC): orchestration wiring to extracted collaborators.

Targeted verification:
- `npm run build` (pass)
- `npx vitest run interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/command-argument-binder.test.ts interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/command-invoker.test.ts interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/helpers.test.ts interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/output-processor.test.ts interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/stage-output-cache.test.ts interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor.characterization.test.ts interpreter/eval/pipeline/command-execution.characterization.test.ts tests/interpreter/hooks/pipeline-context.test.ts tests/pipeline/parallel-runtime.test.ts tests/pipeline/data-handling.test.ts tests/pipeline/exec-structured.test.ts` (pass)

No new sub-60 runtime module introduced.
No callback-lambda service injection introduced.

**2026-02-11 05:45 UTC:** Full phase gate completed green.

Full gate command:
- npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
