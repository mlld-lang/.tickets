# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor.ts - Phase 3: Extract command resolution and argument binding

Objective:
Modularize command-reference resolution, argument evaluation, and parameter binding logic.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract argument-processing logic (`processArguments`, argument-node evaluation, and auto-binding) into dedicated command invocation helpers.
- Extract command-reference resolution/execution wrapper logic into a cohesive collaborator.
- Keep lazy imports and wrapper-preservation semantics intact for pipeline inputs.
- Add tests that cover explicit args, auto-binding (single and multi-parameter), variable reference field access, and command label descriptor composition.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Command resolution and argument/binding responsibilities move out of `PipelineExecutor` into dedicated module(s).
2. Command invocation behavior remains stable across baseline scenarios.
3. Exit criteria: all tests pass with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
