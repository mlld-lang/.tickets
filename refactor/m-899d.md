# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/exe.ts - Phase 4: Extract executable definition builders (core subtype families)



Objective:
Modularize subtype-specific definition creation for core executable families.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract builders for command/data/value/code/template/template-file/section/resolver/prose subtype branches.
- Preserve each executable definition shape and source metadata fields.
- Add tests verifying generated executableDef structures for each extracted subtype family.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 17:07 UTC:** Extracted core executable subtype builders into interpreter/eval/exe/core-definition-builders.ts and rewired interpreter/eval/exe.ts to consume a single core-build dispatch result before control-flow branches.

Touched runtime modules:
- interpreter/eval/exe/core-definition-builders.ts (560 LOC): owns command/data/value/code/resolver/template/template-file/section/prose subtype construction and exeValue materialization.
- interpreter/eval/exe.ts (391 LOC): owns evaluateExe orchestration and control-flow subtype branches while delegating core subtype families.

Phase checklist coverage:
- Extracted builders for command/data/value/code/template/template-file/section/resolver/prose families.
- Preserved executable definition shapes and metadata fields in extracted core builders.
- Expanded executable shape characterization in interpreter/eval/exe.characterization.test.ts with commandRef/data/templateFile/proseFile cases.

Validation:
- npm run build && npx vitest run interpreter/eval/exe.characterization.test.ts interpreter/eval/exe/definition-helpers.test.ts interpreter/eval/if.test.ts interpreter/eval/env-directive.test.ts (PASS)
- npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples (PASS)

Guardrails:
- No new runtime module under 60 LOC was introduced.
- No callback-lambda service injection was introduced.
- Dependency direction in interpreter/eval/exe* remains acyclic for touched modules.
