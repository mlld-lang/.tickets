# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/exe.ts - Phase 4: Extract executable definition builders (core subtype families)



Objective:
Modularize subtype-specific definition creation for core executable families.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract builders for command/data/value/code/template/template-file/section/resolver/prose subtype branches.
- Preserve each executable definition shape and source metadata fields.
- Add tests verifying generated executableDef structures for each extracted subtype family.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
