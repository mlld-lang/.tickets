# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/var.ts - Phase 6: Extract variable construction strategies

Objective:
Extract variable construction and metadata attachment into strategy-based builders.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Move variable creation logic (type selection + source metadata + security metadata application) into dedicated module(s) (example target: `interpreter/eval/var/variable-builder.ts`).
- Replace long variable-construction condition chains with strategy functions keyed by RHS/value shape and wrapper metadata.
- Preserve behavior for:
  - primitive vs text vs template variable creation
  - triple-colon template AST preservation
  - structured value wrapping
  - existing Variable wrapper preservation
  - retryability metadata and sourceFunction attachment
  - tool collection metadata attachment
- Add targeted tests for variable factory selection and metadata propagation.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Variable construction logic is extracted into dedicated strategy module(s).
2. Variable type selection and metadata/security behavior remain unchanged.
3. Added tests verify factory outcomes and metadata flags for representative RHS shapes.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples


**2026-02-11 04:56 UTC:** Phase 6 implementation complete.

What changed:
- Extracted variable construction strategy logic from var.ts into interpreter/eval/var/variable-builder.ts.
- Rewired interpreter/eval/var.ts to delegate variable creation to createVariableBuilder(...).build(...).
- Preserved variable-construction behavior for primitive/text/template wrappers, structured value wrapping, existing Variable wrapper handling, triple-colon template AST preservation, retryability/sourceFunction metadata, and tool collection metadata.
- Added targeted tests in interpreter/eval/var/variable-builder.test.ts for strategy outcomes and metadata propagation.

Checklist completion:
- [x] Extract variable creation logic into dedicated strategy module(s).
- [x] Replace long construction condition chain with strategy-keyed builder branching.
- [x] Preserve metadata/security behavior and wrapper semantics.
- [x] Add targeted tests for factory outcomes and metadata propagation.

Touched runtime modules and ownership:
- interpreter/eval/var/variable-builder.ts (620 lines): owns strategy selection and variable construction for RHS/value-node shapes; owns base context/internal metadata composition and security option application for variable factory calls.
- interpreter/eval/var.ts (520 lines): owns orchestration flow and delegates variable construction to variable-builder.

Targeted verification:
- npm run build -> PASS
- npx vitest run interpreter/eval/var/variable-builder.test.ts interpreter/eval/var.characterization.test.ts tests/interpreter/security-metadata.test.ts interpreter/eval/run.structured.test.ts interpreter/eval/show.structured.test.ts -> PASS

Phase full-gate exit criteria:
- npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples -> PASS

Guardrail confirmations:
- No new runtime module under 60 lines was introduced.
- No callback-lambda service injection was introduced.
- Shared behavior stays centralized in variable-builder helpers (no duplicated sibling logic introduced in this phase).
