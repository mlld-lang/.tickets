# Phase 6: Introduce handler map for non-command/non-code executables

Objective:
Introduce explicit executable-type handlers for non-command/non-code paths.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Replace the monolithic executable-type branching with handler modules for:
  - node function/class
  - template
  - data
  - pipeline executable
  - command-ref
  - section
  - resolver
- Keep command and code handlers in place for later phases.
- Preserve unknown-type and error handling behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Non-command/non-code executable paths use dedicated handlers.
2. Dispatch structure is clearer and preserves behavior.
3. Existing tests for these executable types remain green.
4. Full test gate passes and output is attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
