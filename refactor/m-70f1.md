# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/hooks/guard-post-hook.ts - Phase 1: Extract override and guard selection utilities



Objective:
Separate override parsing and guard candidate discovery from orchestration.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- In scope: override parsing/normalization/filtering and guard selection utility extraction.
- Out of scope: decision engine and retry enforcement extraction.
- Extract with-clause override parsing/normalization/filtering and operation-key derivation utilities.
- Extract per-input/per-operation guard collection helpers and ensure dedupe/order behavior remains unchanged.
- Add focused tests for override filtering and operation key derivation coverage.

Module boundaries:
- Override utility handles parsing and filter semantics only.
- Guard selection utility handles candidate ordering, dedupe, and operation-key derivation.
- Hook orchestrator remains owner of control flow.

Preserve behavior checks:
- Override semantics remain unchanged.
- Guard selection precedence remains unchanged.
- Candidate dedupe and order behavior remain unchanged.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Override and selection logic are extracted into focused modules.
2. Selection precedence and override behavior remain baseline-compatible.
3. Tests cover precedence, dedupe, and operation key derivation.
4. Exit criteria: test gate command succeeds and output is attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
