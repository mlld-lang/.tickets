# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/exe.ts - Phase 0: Baseline and characterization



Objective:
Establish baseline coverage for all exec subtype and block-evaluation behavior.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Map responsibilities across exe-block execution, subtype-to-definition mapping, metadata/security assembly, and shadow wrapper behavior.
- Add characterization coverage for representative exec subtypes (command/code/template/value/section/resolver/prose/loop/for/foreach/when/block).
- Capture extraction seams and regression risks; do not move code across files in this phase.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 16:39 UTC:** Phase completion evidence:\n- Scope implemented: baseline/characterization only; no runtime extraction in this phase.\n- Runtime modules touched with line counts + ownership:\n  - interpreter/eval/exe.ts (1469 LOC): retained as baseline orchestration target; characterization maps subtype-definition routing, security metadata assembly, shadow wrapper behavior, and exe-block return boundaries.\n- Test coverage added:\n  - interpreter/eval/exe.characterization.test.ts (338 LOC) with representative subtype cases (command/code/template/value/section/resolver/prose/when/foreach/for/loop/block), security metadata assertion, shadow wrapper registration, and exe-block return behavior checks.\n- Targeted tests run (pass):\n  - npx vitest run interpreter/eval/exe.characterization.test.ts\n- Full gate run (pass):\n  - npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples\n- Guardrails:\n  - No new runtime modules introduced under 60 LOC.\n  - No callback-lambda service injection introduced.\n  - No duplicated shared runtime logic introduced in this phase.\n  - Dependency direction remains unchanged/acyclic in touched area.
