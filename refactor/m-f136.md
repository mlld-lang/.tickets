# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/exe.ts - Phase 0: Baseline and characterization



Objective:
Establish baseline coverage for all exec subtype and block-evaluation behavior.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Map responsibilities across exe-block execution, subtype-to-definition mapping, metadata/security assembly, and shadow wrapper behavior.
- Add characterization coverage for representative exec subtypes (command/code/template/value/section/resolver/prose/loop/for/foreach/when/block).
- Capture extraction seams and regression risks; do not move code across files in this phase.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
