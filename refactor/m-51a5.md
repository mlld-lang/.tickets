# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.ts - Phase 7: Final composition cleanup and registry verification



Objective:
Reduce `ast-extractor.ts` to registry/orchestration glue.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Refactor top-level exports to route through extracted pattern core and language extractor registry.
- Remove duplicate helper code and verify module dependency directions remain acyclic.
- Attach architecture notes describing extractor registry layout and extension mapping ownership.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
