# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.ts - Phase 7: Final composition cleanup and registry verification



Objective:
Reduce `ast-extractor.ts` to registry/orchestration glue.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Refactor top-level exports to route through extracted pattern core and language extractor registry.
- Remove duplicate helper code and verify module dependency directions remain acyclic.
- Attach architecture notes describing extractor registry layout and extension mapping ownership.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 19:46 UTC:** --dir refactor Completed phase-7 final composition cleanup and registry verification for ast-extractor. Runtime modules touched: interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.ts (77 lines, orchestration-only entrypoint with extractAst/extractNames + registry wiring), interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/registry-composition.test.ts (phase-specific registry/fallback routing verification), plus existing extracted runtime modules remain owners of language and pattern responsibilities. Registry layout: ast-extractor.ts owns AST_EXTRACTOR_REGISTRY composition only; language-dispatch.ts owns extension-to-extractor key mapping and dispatch (resolveAstExtractorKey + extractDefinitionsForFile); pattern-core.ts owns pattern evaluation and filtering semantics; language modules own per-language definition extraction; shared-utils.ts owns reusable line/block/definition slicing primitives. Extension mapping ownership: language-dispatch.ts is the single mapping authority for file-extension routing (including .py/.pyi, C/C++ extension set, and TS fallback). Targeted checks passed: npm run build && npx vitest run interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/registry-composition.test.ts interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/language-group-d.test.ts interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/language-group-c.test.ts interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/language-group-b.test.ts interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/language-group-a.test.ts interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.characterization.test.ts interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/language-dispatch.test.ts interpreter/eval/content-loader-ast.test.ts interpreter/eval/alligator.structured.test.ts. Full gate passed: npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples. No new sub-60 runtime modules introduced. No callback-lambda service injection introduced.
