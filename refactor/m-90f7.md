# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/for.ts - Phase 2: Extract iteration value wrapping and binding helpers



Objective:
Modularize iteration variable creation and binding utilities.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract ensureVariable/file-metadata wrapping logic and key/field-path helper utilities into a dedicated binding module.
- Preserve LoadContentResult/StructuredValue metadata behavior and field-access error enhancement behavior.
- Add tests for iteration variable metadata and key-field validation behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
