# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/for.ts - Phase 2: Extract iteration value wrapping and binding helpers



Objective:
Modularize iteration variable creation and binding utilities.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract ensureVariable/file-metadata wrapping logic and key/field-path helper utilities into a dedicated binding module.
- Preserve LoadContentResult/StructuredValue metadata behavior and field-access error enhancement behavior.
- Add tests for iteration variable metadata and key-field validation behavior.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 20:05 UTC:** --dir refactor Phase 2 completed: extracted iteration value wrapping and binding helpers.\n\nWhat changed:\n- Added interpreter/eval/for/binding-utils.ts (269 lines) and moved binding-oriented helpers from for.ts:\n  - ensureVariable (including LoadContentResult/StructuredValue/file-like metadata handling)\n  - key/field helpers (formatFieldPath, formatFieldNodeForError, assertKeyVariableHasNoFields, withIterationMxKey)\n  - field-access support helpers (isFieldAccessResultLike, enhanceFieldAccessError)\n  - shouldKeepStructuredForForExpression\n- Updated interpreter/eval/for.ts to import binding helpers and remove duplicated inline binding logic.\n- Expanded characterization tests for binding metadata behavior:\n  - object-iteration @item.mx.key propagation\n  - file-like object metadata propagation to @file.mx.*\n\nTouched runtime modules and ownership:\n- interpreter/eval/for/binding-utils.ts (269 lines): owns iteration binding, metadata wrapping, key/field validation and field-access error enhancement.\n- interpreter/eval/for.ts (915 lines): keeps directive/expression orchestration and uses extracted binding service helpers.\n- interpreter/eval/for/parallel-options.ts (143 lines): unchanged logic ownership from phase 1; reused by orchestrator.\n\nTargeted verification (pass):\n- npm run build\n- npx vitest run interpreter/eval/for.characterization.test.ts interpreter/eval/for-expression-mx.test.ts interpreter/eval/for-expression-when.test.ts interpreter/eval/for-nested-empty.test.ts tests/for/key-binding.test.ts tests/for/parallel-runtime.test.ts tests/integration/for-expr-error-propagation.test.ts\n\nPhase exit gate (pass):\n- npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples\n  - Note: first full-gate attempt had two timing-threshold flakes in tests/parallel/shell-commands-parallel.test.ts; reran and obtained full green gate without code changes to that suite.\n\nGuardrail confirmations:\n- No sub-60 runtime module introduced (new runtime module is 269 lines).\n- No callback-lambda service injection introduced.\n- Shared binding helpers are defined once in binding-utils.ts and imported where needed.\n- Dependency direction remains acyclic across interpreter/eval/for* touched modules.
