# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/exe.ts



Largest unplanned target file: `interpreter/eval/exe.ts` (~1,469 LOC).

This epic coordinates a phased refactor that decomposes executable-definition and exe-block logic into focused modules while preserving executable definition semantics, shadow environment capture behavior, metadata/capability propagation, and runtime wrapper behavior.

Execution order:
1. Phase 0 through Phase 7 proceed strictly in order.
2. Each phase closes only after its exit criteria are met.
3. No phase starts until its dependency ticket is closed.

Cross-phase constraints:
- Keep exported APIs stable: `evaluateExe` and `evaluateExeBlock`.
- Preserve supported exec subtypes and resulting executable definition shapes.
- Preserve security metadata/capability context propagation and autosign behavior.
- Preserve shadow env capture/rehydration semantics and JS sync wrapper behavior.
- Preserve control-flow behavior for exe-block, when-expression returns, and loop control markers.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase tickets (0-7) exist under this epic and are dependency-linked in sequence.
2. Each phase ticket includes explicit implementation instructions and explicit exit criteria.
3. Final structure splits responsibilities into cohesive modules under `interpreter/eval/exe/` (or equivalent) and reduces `exe.ts` to orchestration.
4. Final validation command passes with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
