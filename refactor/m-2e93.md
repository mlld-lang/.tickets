# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/core/interpreter.ts - Phase 4: Extract specialized expression/node evaluators



Objective:
Isolate specialized node-family evaluators into explicit modules with stable return contracts.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- In scope: extract specialized handlers for complex node families listed in this ticket.
- Out of scope: top-level dispatch semantics, interpolation/security adapter extraction, and namespace utility extraction.
- Split node-family handlers into modules under `interpreter/core/interpreter/handlers/` (or equivalent) with one module per family cluster.
- Preserve delegation boundaries and return-shape contracts for each family.
- Add tests for parity across ExecInvocation, VariableReferenceWithTail, NewExpression, LabelModification, unified expressions, control-flow nodes (`when`/`for`/`loop`/`foreach`), load-content/file-reference, code, and command nodes.

Module boundaries:
- Each specialized handler owns one node family and receives explicit interpreter context.
- Shared helper dependencies are imported through stable utility modules only.
- Handler modules do not alter global intent/effect ordering rules.

Preserve behavior checks:
- Node-family return shapes and wrappers remain baseline-compatible.
- Delegation boundaries remain stable between dispatch and specialized handlers.
- Control-flow node semantics remain unchanged.
- Load-content/file-reference and command/code node behavior remains unchanged.

Micro-checklist (node-family drift guard):
- Add one positive and one negative-path test per extracted node family cluster (`ExecInvocation`, `VariableReferenceWithTail`, `NewExpression`, `LabelModification`, unified expressions, control-flow, load-content/file-reference, code, command).
- Add a dispatch-to-handler identity assertion for each family so routing drift fails fast.
- Assert return-shape invariants per family (primitive/wrapper/object expectations) using baseline snapshots.
- Assert expression-context vs document-context behavior remains unchanged for families that depend on context.
- Assert effect/intent ordering remains unchanged for families that emit effects.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Specialized node-family handlers are extracted into cohesive modules with explicit boundaries.
2. Delegation behavior and return contracts remain baseline-compatible.
3. Preserve-behavior checks are covered for each listed node family.
4. Every item in the micro-checklist is backed by explicit tests before closing this phase.
5. Exit criteria: test gate command succeeds and output is attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
