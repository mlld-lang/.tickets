# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/exe.ts - Phase 6: Extract variable creation and metadata/security assembly



Objective:
Centralize executable variable construction and metadata wiring.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract capability/security context assembly, executable variable creation, template assignment, and autosign integration into a dedicated module.
- Preserve descriptor merge behavior, captured shadow/module env metadata, and source syntax tagging rules.
- Add tests for metadata fields and security descriptor propagation across subtype families.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
