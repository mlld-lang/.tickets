# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/exe.ts - Phase 6: Extract variable creation and metadata/security assembly



Objective:
Centralize executable variable construction and metadata wiring.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract capability/security context assembly, executable variable creation, template assignment, and autosign integration into a dedicated module.
- Preserve descriptor merge behavior, captured shadow/module env metadata, and source syntax tagging rules.
- Add tests for metadata fields and security descriptor propagation across subtype families.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 17:18 UTC:** Extracted executable variable/materialization and security-context assembly into interpreter/eval/exe/variable-assembly.ts and rewired interpreter/eval/exe.ts to delegate post-definition registration/autosign work through that runtime module.

Touched runtime modules:
- interpreter/eval/exe/variable-assembly.ts (198 LOC): owns security/capability context creation, source syntax tagging, descriptor taint merge for command subtype, captured shadow/module metadata capture, executable variable creation, template assignment, and autosign integration.
- interpreter/eval/exe.ts (107 LOC): owns evaluateExe orchestration and subtype dispatch only.

Phase checklist coverage:
- Extracted capability/security context assembly and executable variable materialization.
- Preserved captured shadow/module env metadata behavior and source syntax tagging across subtype families.
- Expanded characterization coverage in interpreter/eval/exe.characterization.test.ts for source syntax tagging and metadata/security propagation behavior.

Validation:
- npm run build && npx vitest run interpreter/eval/exe.characterization.test.ts interpreter/eval/exe/control-flow-definition-builders.test.ts interpreter/eval/exe/definition-helpers.test.ts tests/interpreter/security-metadata.test.ts interpreter/eval/if.test.ts (PASS)
- npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples (PASS)

Guardrails:
- No new runtime module under 60 LOC was introduced.
- No callback-lambda service injection was introduced.
- Dependency direction in interpreter/eval/exe* remains acyclic for touched modules.
