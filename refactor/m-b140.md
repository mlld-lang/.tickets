# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/env/Environment.ts - Phase 8: Final API audit, cleanup, and architecture docs

Objective:
Finalize `Environment` as a composition root/facade and document the resulting architecture.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Remove dead/duplicated internal paths exposed during extraction phases.
- Ensure each collaborator has a single clear responsibility and stable dependency direction.
- Audit call sites to confirm public `Environment` API remains coherent and backwards-compatible.
- Update developer docs (at minimum `docs/dev/INTERPRETER.md` and any focused env docs) to reflect module boundaries and responsibilities.
- Record residual risk and follow-up opportunities in ticket notes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `interpreter/env/Environment.ts` is materially smaller and primarily composes collaborators.
2. Internal module boundaries are coherent and avoid circular responsibilities.
3. Developer documentation reflects the final architecture.
4. Exit criteria: full test gate passes with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
