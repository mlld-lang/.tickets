# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor.ts - Phase 4: Extract inline and while stage executors

Objective:
Extract inline-stage and while-stage adapters into specialized executors.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Isolate inline command stage execution (interpolation, policy checks, label-flow enforcement, command execution context wiring).
- Isolate inline value stage execution and while-stage processor command adaptation.
- Keep working-directory resolution and security enforcement semantics unchanged.
- Add focused tests for inline command deny/allow behavior, inline value descriptor propagation, and while-processor adaptation.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Inline-command, inline-value, and while-adapter logic are implemented in dedicated module(s).
2. Policy/label-flow and descriptor behavior match baseline coverage.
3. Exit criteria: all tests pass with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 05:52 UTC:** Phase 4 extraction implemented.

Scope completed:
- Extracted inline command + inline value execution into `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/inline-stage-executor.ts`.
- Extracted while-processor command/input adaptation into `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/while-stage-adapter.ts`.
- Rewired `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor.ts` to delegate inline stage execution and while adaptation collaborators.
- Added focused tests:
  - `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/inline-stage-executor.test.ts`
  - `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/while-stage-adapter.test.ts`

Touched runtime modules + ownership:
- `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/inline-stage-executor.ts` (159 LOC): inline command interpolation/policy/label-flow/command execution context wiring + inline value descriptor propagation.
- `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/while-stage-adapter.ts` (111 LOC): while-processor command adaptation and state normalization.
- `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor.ts` (1080 LOC): orchestration wiring to extracted collaborators.
- `interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/types.ts` (33 LOC, type-only exception): shared context-factory contract.

Targeted verification:
- `npm run build` (pass)
- `npx vitest run interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/inline-stage-executor.test.ts interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/while-stage-adapter.test.ts interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/command-argument-binder.test.ts interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/command-invoker.test.ts interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/helpers.test.ts interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/output-processor.test.ts interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor/stage-output-cache.test.ts interpreter/eval/pipeline/executor.characterization.test.ts interpreter/eval/pipeline/command-execution.characterization.test.ts tests/interpreter/hooks/pipeline-context.test.ts tests/pipeline/parallel-runtime.test.ts tests/pipeline/data-handling.test.ts tests/pipeline/exec-structured.test.ts` (pass)

No new sub-60 runtime module introduced (type-only exception: `executor/types.ts`).
No callback-lambda service injection introduced.

**2026-02-11 05:53 UTC:** Full phase gate completed green.

Full gate command:
- npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

Results:
- build: pass
- npm test: pass (Test Files: 332 passed, 7 skipped; Tests: 3754 passed, 63 skipped)
- test:tokens: pass (Test Files: 6 passed; Tests: 331 passed, 6 skipped)
- test:examples: pass (Test Files: 1 passed; Tests: 1353 passed, 2 skipped)
