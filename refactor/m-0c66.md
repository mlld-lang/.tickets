# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.ts - Phase 5: Extract C/C++ extractor module



Objective:
Isolate the complex C/C++ extractor path.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Move C/C++ extractor logic (comment stripping, pending signature parsing, class context tracking) into a dedicated module.
- Preserve function/method/class/enum/variable extraction behavior and false-positive guards.
- Add tests for key C++ constructs covered by the current parser heuristics.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 19:08 UTC:** --dir refactor Completed phase-5 C/C++ extraction into a dedicated module. Runtime modules touched: interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/cpp-extractor.ts (214 lines, owns C/C++ comment stripping, pending signature parsing, class context tracking, function/method/class/enum/variable extraction heuristics and guards), interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.ts (465 lines, orchestrator/registry wiring updated to import the extracted C/C++ module and keep remaining language extractors). Added phase-specific tests: interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/language-group-c.test.ts (class-context + out-of-class method parsing, enum/variable extraction, comment stripping, false-positive guard, multiline signature parsing). Targeted checks passed: npm run build && npx vitest run interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/language-group-c.test.ts interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/language-group-b.test.ts interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/language-group-a.test.ts interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.characterization.test.ts interpreter/eval/ast-extractor/language-dispatch.test.ts interpreter/eval/content-loader-ast.test.ts interpreter/eval/alligator.structured.test.ts. Full gate passed: npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples. No new sub-60 runtime modules introduced. No callback-lambda service injection introduced.
