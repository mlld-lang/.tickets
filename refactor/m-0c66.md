# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/ast-extractor.ts - Phase 5: Extract C/C++ extractor module



Objective:
Isolate the complex C/C++ extractor path.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Move C/C++ extractor logic (comment stripping, pending signature parsing, class context tracking) into a dedicated module.
- Preserve function/method/class/enum/variable extraction behavior and false-positive guards.
- Add tests for key C++ constructs covered by the current parser heuristics.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
