# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/show.ts - Phase 1: Extract shared descriptor/materialization and policy helpers



Objective:
Isolate shared cross-subtype helper logic.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract descriptor merge helpers, source/interpolated descriptor collection, and display materialization glue.
- Extract policy-check and effect-emission helper utilities without changing current guard/label behavior.
- Add tests covering descriptor merge precedence and policy-check invocation paths.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 17:56 UTC:** --dir refactor Implemented phase 1 helper extraction for show evaluator.

Touched runtime modules:
- interpreter/eval/show/shared-helpers.ts (218 LOC): descriptor collection (interpolated/source + pipeline hints), output normalization/materialization, policy-check dispatch, effect emission, result descriptor assembly, and structured wrapping.
- interpreter/eval/show.ts (1346 LOC): delegated shared descriptor/materialization/policy/effect/wrapping logic to shared-helpers while preserving subtype behavior.

Tests added/updated:
- interpreter/eval/show/shared-helpers.test.ts (133 LOC): descriptor merge precedence and policy-check invocation-path coverage.
- Existing show suites exercised for parity.

Targeted checks:
- npm run build ✅
- npx vitest run interpreter/eval/show/shared-helpers.test.ts interpreter/eval/show.characterization.test.ts interpreter/eval/show.structured.test.ts ✅

Phase full gate:
- npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples ✅

Guardrail attestations:
- No new runtime module under 60 LOC (new runtime module is 218 LOC).
- No callback-lambda service injection introduced; helper composition uses direct function/module boundaries.
- No duplicated descriptor/policy helper logic across sibling modules in touched area.
