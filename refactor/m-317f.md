# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/show.ts - Phase 1: Extract shared descriptor/materialization and policy helpers



Objective:
Isolate shared cross-subtype helper logic.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Extract descriptor merge helpers, source/interpolated descriptor collection, and display materialization glue.
- Extract policy-check and effect-emission helper utilities without changing current guard/label behavior.
- Add tests covering descriptor merge precedence and policy-check invocation paths.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
