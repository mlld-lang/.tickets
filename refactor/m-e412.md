# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/var.ts - Phase 9: Final composition cleanup and architecture verification

Objective:
Finalize composition cleanup and verify the modular architecture end-to-end.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Reduce `interpreter/eval/var.ts` to orchestration/composition responsibilities with clear imports from extracted modules.
- Remove duplication and dead helpers left by previous phases.
- Keep `prepareVarAssignment` and `evaluateVar` entrypoints stable.
- Add/update dev documentation for the resulting module boundaries and call flow (link from existing interpreter docs).
- Attach a concise architecture map in the ticket notes with module ownership and data flow.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `interpreter/eval/var.ts` is materially smaller and primarily orchestration.
2. Module boundaries for `/var` evaluation are documented and traceable.
3. No behavior regression is introduced across characterization and integration coverage.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
