# Phase 1: Extract pure helper utilities from exec-invocation

Objective:
Extract pure helper utilities from `interpreter/eval/exec-invocation.ts` without changing control flow.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Move stateless helpers into dedicated modules (suggested: `interpreter/eval/exec/context.ts` and neighboring files):
  - operation type resolution
  - security descriptor carrier/merge helpers
  - auth/using with-clause merge helper
  - shadow env deserialization helper
  - other pure formatting/normalization helpers
- Keep function signatures and call behavior stable.
- Do not alter execution ordering or side effects.
- Keep `evaluateExecInvocation` exported from `exec-invocation.ts`.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Pure helpers are extracted and imported from focused modules.
2. `evaluateExecInvocation` public entrypoint remains stable.
3. No behavioral drift is observed in characterization tests.
4. Full test gate passes and output is attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples


**2026-02-10 19:03 UTC:** Completed Phase 1 helper extraction from exec-invocation with no control-flow changes.

Checklist completion:
- [x] Extracted operation type resolution helper (`resolveOpTypeFromLanguage`).
- [x] Extracted security descriptor carrier/get/set helpers.
- [x] Extracted auth/using with-clause merge helper.
- [x] Extracted shadow env deserialization helper.
- [x] Kept `evaluateExecInvocation` exported from `interpreter/eval/exec-invocation.ts` and preserved call behavior.

Touched runtime modules and ownership:
- `interpreter/eval/exec/context.ts` (84 LOC): operation preview construction, language->op mapping, auth/using merge, shadow-env map deserialization.
- `interpreter/eval/exec/security-descriptor.ts` (61 LOC): centralized security descriptor extraction/propagation for variable and structured carriers.
- `interpreter/eval/exec/normalization.ts` (63 LOC): autoverify path normalization, template-node extraction, template AST creation, signed variable name normalization.
- `interpreter/eval/exec-invocation.ts` (3952 LOC): imports extracted helpers and removes duplicated inline helper implementations.

Wave 2 guardrail attestation:
- No new runtime module under 60 LOC was introduced.
- No callback-lambda service-composition injection was introduced.
- Shared helper/type contracts introduced once in extracted modules and imported at call sites.
- Dependency direction remains acyclic in touched area (`exec-invocation.ts` -> `exec/*` only).

Targeted test evidence:
- `npx vitest run interpreter/eval/exec-invocation.structured.test.ts interpreter/eval/exec-invocation.env-injection.test.ts interpreter/eval/exec-invocation.autoverify.test.ts interpreter/eval/pipeline/command-execution/handlers/execute-command-ref.test.ts tests/interpreter/hooks/guard-pre-hook.test.ts` => PASS.

Full gate evidence:
- `npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples` => PASS.
