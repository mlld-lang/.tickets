# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/when.ts - Phase 0: Baseline and characterization



Objective:
Establish baseline coverage for condition and action semantics before extraction.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Map responsibilities across assignment value evaluation, when form handlers, condition evaluation, and truthiness/comparison helpers.
- Add characterization tests for match/block/simple forms, none placement, exec-in-condition behavior, and control propagation.
- Document extraction seams and regression risks; do not move code across files in this phase.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase objectives for this slice are fully implemented with cohesive module boundaries.
2. Runtime behavior, error surface, and metadata contracts remain aligned with baseline expectations.
3. Phase-specific coverage is added or updated for the extracted responsibilities.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples

**2026-02-11 15:42 UTC:** Phase 0 characterization complete.\n\nScope/seams documented in tests across when simple/match/block behavior, none placement validation, exec-in-condition truthiness/implicit-arg forwarding, and exe return-control propagation.\n\nTouched runtime modules:\n- none (phase is characterization-only; no runtime code movement)\n\nTouched test modules:\n- interpreter/eval/when.characterization.test.ts (279 LOC): characterization coverage for stable baseline behaviors before extraction.\n\nTargeted checks run:\n- npm run build && npm test -- interpreter/eval/when.characterization.test.ts interpreter/eval/when.test.ts interpreter/eval/for-expression-when.test.ts (pass)\n\nFull gate run:\n- npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples (pass)\n\nGuardrail confirmations:\n- No new sub-60 runtime module introduced (no runtime module added in this phase).\n- No callback-lambda service injection introduced.

**2026-02-11 15:42 UTC:** Correction: interpreter/eval/when.characterization.test.ts current line count is 293 LOC.
