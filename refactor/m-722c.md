# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/for.ts



Largest unplanned target file: `interpreter/eval/for.ts` (~1,184 LOC).

This epic coordinates a phased refactor that decomposes for-directive and for-expression execution into focused modules while preserving iteration semantics, parallel execution behavior, control-flow propagation, and error/context reporting behavior.

Execution order:
1. Phase 0 through Phase 7 proceed strictly in order.
2. Each phase closes only after its exit criteria are met.
3. No phase starts until its dependency ticket is closed.

Cross-phase constraints:
- Keep exported APIs stable: `evaluateForDirective` and `evaluateForExpression`.
- Preserve iteration binding behavior for item/key variables, field access derivatives, and metadata propagation.
- Preserve parallel cap/rate resolution and retry/error handling semantics.
- Preserve control-flow behavior for done/continue and exe-return propagation.
- Preserve batch pipeline behavior for for-expression outputs.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Phase tickets (0-7) exist under this epic and are dependency-linked in sequence.
2. Each phase ticket includes explicit implementation instructions and explicit exit criteria.
3. Final structure splits responsibilities into cohesive modules under `interpreter/eval/for/` (or equivalent) and reduces `for.ts` to orchestration.
4. Final validation command passes with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
