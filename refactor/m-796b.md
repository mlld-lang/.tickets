# Refactor Program: Modularize interpreter/eval/var.ts - Phase 2: Extract collection complexity and recursive evaluators

Objective:
Extract collection complexity detection and recursive item evaluation logic.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Move `hasComplexValues`, `hasComplexArrayItems`, and `evaluateArrayItem` into dedicated evaluator module(s) (example target: `interpreter/eval/var/collection-evaluator.ts`).
- Isolate shared recursion behavior for nested object/array entries to remove duplicated handling branches.
- Keep lazy/eager thresholds unchanged for spread entries, conditional pairs, nested complex nodes, wrappers, and parser legacy shapes.
- Keep security descriptor collection hooks intact for variable references and interpolated content in collections.
- Add targeted tests for nested arrays/objects, wrapped literals/text, and variable reference handling inside collections.

## Wave 2 Phase Guardrails

Required design constraints for this phase:
- Do not create runtime modules under 60 lines unless the file is a pure type-definition file or re-export barrel.
- Do not duplicate shared logic across sibling modules in this area; extract a shared helper/service when behavior overlaps.
- Do not introduce constructor callback-lambda injection as a service-composition strategy; use interface-typed service objects.
- Define shared result/context/types/type-guards once per extraction area and import them instead of re-declaring.
- Keep module dependency direction acyclic in the touched area before closing the phase.

Evidence required in the phase note before close:
- Touched runtime modules with line counts and a short ownership note per module.
- Targeted test commands run for this phase and pass/fail status.
- Explicit statement that no new sub-60 runtime module was introduced (or list allowed type/barrel exceptions).
- Explicit statement that no callback-lambda service injection was introduced (or justify a recursion-only exception).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Collection complexity checks and recursive item evaluation are extracted behind stable helper interfaces.
2. Lazy/eager behavior and descriptor propagation for collection values remain unchanged.
3. Added tests cover nested and mixed-shape collection scenarios.
4. Exit criteria: all tests pass, with output attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples


**2026-02-11 04:18 UTC:** Phase close evidence:

Implemented extraction:
- interpreter/eval/var/collection-evaluator.ts (388 LOC): owns collection complexity detection (, ) and recursive collection evaluation (, , ) including descriptor collection for VariableReference items.
- interpreter/eval/var.ts (1567 LOC): collection handling is orchestration-only for non-complex arrays/objects via shared collection evaluator calls; duplicated entry/property recursion branches removed.

Tests added/updated:
- interpreter/eval/var/collection-evaluator.test.ts: targeted coverage for nested arrays/objects, wrapped literal/text handling, variable reference descriptor collection, and strict pair-only object entry enforcement.

Checklist status:
- [x] Moved hasComplexValues/hasComplexArrayItems/evaluateArrayItem into dedicated collection evaluator module.
- [x] Isolated shared recursion for entries/properties via shared evaluateCollectionObject/evaluateArrayItems paths.
- [x] Preserved lazy/eager thresholds and descriptor collection behavior in collection flows.
- [x] Added targeted nested/wrapped/reference collection tests.

Targeted tests:
- npm run build -> PASS
- npx vitest run interpreter/eval/var/collection-evaluator.test.ts interpreter/eval/var.characterization.test.ts tests/interpreter/security-metadata.test.ts -> PASS
- npx vitest run interpreter/interpreter.fixture.test.ts -t "collection-element-access-array|collection-element-access-object|var-data-object|var-data-array|var-string-in-nested-structures|audit-log-taint|expression-descriptor|pipeline-taint" -> PASS

Full gate:
- npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples -> PASS

Guardrail evidence:
- No new sub-60 runtime modules introduced (new runtime module is 388 LOC; no type/barrel exception needed).
- No callback-lambda service injection introduced; composition remains direct module/service calls.
- Touched  dependency direction remains acyclic for this extraction ( imports collection evaluator; collection evaluator only imports shared evaluator/security utilities and does not import ).
