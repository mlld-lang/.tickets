# Phase 4: Extract argument normalization and parameter binding

Objective:
Extract argument normalization and parameter binding logic.

Instructions for the implementing agent:
- Move argument evaluation/normalization into dedicated module(s) (suggested: `interpreter/eval/exec/args.ts`).
- Preserve handling for structured values, regex literals, data literals, variable references, load-content nodes, nested exec invocation, and template arrays.
- Keep guard candidate/original variable tracking behavior intact.
- Extract parameter variable binding into small testable helpers.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Argument normalization and parameter binding are extracted and covered by tests.
2. Structured-value and security descriptor behavior for args remains unchanged.
3. Characterization tests for env injection and structured invocation remain green.
4. Full test gate passes and output is attached:
   npm run build && npm test && npm run test:tokens && npm run test:examples
