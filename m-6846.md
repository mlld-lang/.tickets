# Create gotchas atom

New atom: docs/src/atoms/mistakes/gotchas.md. Distilled from orchestrator skill gotchas.md. Keep brief - focus on JS/Python assumption traps. Remove 'bare function calls need run' (now fixed). Add: no // comments, comma-separated labels, no @{} interpolation, <> triggers file loading. Include expanded if/when examples from parse-errors.generated.js cheat sheet.


**2026-02-15 20:45 UTC:** Created docs/src/atoms/mistakes/gotchas.md. Verified traps with test cases. Includes expanded if/when examples, removed obsolete 'bare function calls' gotcha, added no-// comments trap.
