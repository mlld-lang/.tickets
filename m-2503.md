# Restructure main.mld so enforcement guard fires during demo

Final review found enforcement guard (line 61) never fires: exe llm @processWithLlm runs before guard is defined, and audit flow uses non-llm exes. Restructure so guard demonstrably fires.


**2026-02-09 14:54 UTC:** Addressed by ba75bde93. Demo rewritten with guard enforcement demonstrated in STEP 5, guard defined after label demo to avoid blocking dual-audit flow.
