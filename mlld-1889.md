# Docs Phase 1: Feature audit from CHANGELOG

Review CHANGELOG.md to catalog all features added since docs were written.

## Deliverable
A structured list of:
- New directives/syntax added
- New patterns enabled
- Behavioral changes
- Features that may be underdocumented or missing from docs

## Approach
1. Read through CHANGELOG chronologically (oldest to newest)
2. For each entry, note: feature name, what it enables, doc impact
3. Cross-reference against current docs to find gaps
4. Output: fray note with findings for Phase 2
