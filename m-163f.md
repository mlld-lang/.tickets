# Two related features for guards:

1. Guards should be able to add labels to the OPERATION (not just the input). Use case: dynamically classifying git push --force as destructive so that policy rules like no-untrusted-destructive kick in automatically. Currently guards can only modify input labels, which doesn't trigger operation-label-based policy rules.

2. Any value whose labels have been modified by a privileged guard should automatically get a priv-guard-modified label (or similar). This creates an audit trail showing that a privileged guard touched the data, which is important for trust decisions downstream.

Context: blog post guard example wanted to show dynamic operation classification but the mechanism doesn't work today.
