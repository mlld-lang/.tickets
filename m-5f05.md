# Remove aspirational module.yml entry field from docs

## What's wrong

Module structure docs describe an `entry` field in module.yml for specifying a custom entry point. No code reads this field — entry point detection uses a fixed search order. The convention should be: just use index.mld.

## Fix

Remove all `entry` field documentation from module-structure docs. State that index.mld is the entry point convention.
