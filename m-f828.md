# Multiple --env CLI flags only apply the last value

## Current behavior

```bash
mlld run script --env KEY1=val1 --env KEY2=val2
```

Only `KEY2=val2` is available inside the script. `KEY1` is silently dropped.

## Expected behavior

All `--env` flags should accumulate. Both `KEY1` and `KEY2` should be available via `@input`.
