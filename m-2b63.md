# doc: add cross-references (related field) sweep across atoms

## Problem

QA found agents frequently discover answers in a different howto topic from where they started. The related field in frontmatter is the cross-reference mechanism but many atoms have incomplete lists.

Key gaps found by QA:
- run-basics doesn't link to run-params
- run-cwd doesn't reference all 5 runners (only 3)
- script-return doesn't link to when-value-returning
- for-context doesn't link to parallel patterns

## Approach

Could be a doc-writer manifest targeting related field updates. Or a manual sweep.
