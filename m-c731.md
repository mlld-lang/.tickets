# sh block parameters: error on undefined variables passed as arguments

## Problem

When an undefined variable is passed as an argument to a sh block function, mlld passes the literal variable name string instead of erroring:

```mlld
exe @testSh(prompt) = sh { echo "got: $prompt" }
var @result = @testSh(@undefinedVar)
// outputs: got: @undefinedVar
```

This caused a subtle bug in j2bd where `@buildTask` silently failed, leaving `@task` undefined. When `@claudePollEvent(@task, ...)` was called, agents received the literal string "@task" as their prompt instead of the 100KB interpolated template.

## Nuance

The current behavior of passing literal "@" strings is intentional for plain text containing @ symbols (emails, social handles, etc.). We don't want `user@example.com` to error.

The difference is **intent**:
- `@undefinedVar` as a function argument → clearly intended to be a variable, should error
- `user@example.com` in template text → not intended as a variable, should pass through

## Proposed behavior

When a variable reference is used as a **function argument** (not in template text), and that variable is undefined, throw an error:

```
Error: Undefined variable '@task' passed to function @claudePollEvent
```

This preserves the convenience of @ in plain text while catching bugs where variables are expected but undefined.


**2026-02-12 20:55 UTC:** Design decision confirmed: error on undefined variables in function argument position, pass through in template text. Position-based distinction maps to intent.

**2026-02-12 21:52 UTC:** Changed exec argument evaluation to throw when a VariableReference argument is undefined, with message: Undefined variable '@name' passed to function @fn. Added fixture regressions: tests/cases/exceptions/exe-undefined-variable-argument and tests/cases/regression/exe-argument-literal-at-sign (email-style @ text still passes). Ran full suite: npm test (pass). Commit: 6134e1e93.
