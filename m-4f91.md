# Standardize @root over @base in all docs and examples

Both @root and @base already work as aliases for the project root path resolver. @root is clearer and should be the standard.

Action:
- Update all docs to use @root instead of @base
- Update all example scripts (plugins/orchestrate/examples/) to use @root
- Update SKILL.md, gotchas.md, syntax-reference.md
- Update mlld howto content
- Keep @base working (it's an alias) but mark as deprecated in docs
- @root stays outside @mx namespace — it's a path resolver, not a system utility
