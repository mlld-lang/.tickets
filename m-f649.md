# The current audit example (examples/audit/) uses blind invalidation — adversary gets the same tools/context as the reviewer. The QA workflow (llm/run/qa/) demonstrates the verified-invalidation pattern: Phase 1 constrained exploration → Phase 2 self-review with expanded tool access + empirical verification. This consistently reclassifies 30-50% of Phase 1 findings as false positives. Add a fourth example archetype (or replace audit) showing this pattern. Key elements to port: (1) tool escalation between phases, (2) Chesterton's Fence in the verify prompt, (3) mandatory empirical verification before confirming findings, (4) classification taxonomy (confirmed/false-positive/insufficient-context/needs-human).
