# Improve error for complex inline expressions hitting parse boundaries

Ternaries containing for expressions, nested function calls as args, etc. fail to parse with unhelpful 'Text content not allowed in strict mode' error. The error doesn't indicate the actual issue (complex expression doesn't parse in that position). Should either: (a) support these expressions, or (b) produce a clearer error like 'Complex expressions in ternary conditions should be extracted to exe or let assignments'.

## Acceptance Criteria

When a ternary contains a for expression, the error message points the user toward extracting to an exe or let.
