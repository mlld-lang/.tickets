# Modules: add llm-labeled exe wrappers to @mlld/claude-poll and @local/claude-poll

The claude-poll module exports @claudePoll as an unlabeled executable. To make calls checkpoint-eligible, users must create their own exe llm wrapper — undocumented boilerplate that every checkpoint-enabled orchestrator needs. The module should export pre-labeled variants (e.g. @claudePollLlm) so checkpoint support works out of the box. Applies to all exported functions: @claudePoll, @claudePollEvent, @claudePollJsonl, etc.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. @mlld/claude-poll exports llm-labeled variants of all polling functions. 2. @local/claude-poll updated similarly. 3. Module documentation includes checkpoint usage examples. 4. Existing unlabeled exports preserved for backward compatibility.
