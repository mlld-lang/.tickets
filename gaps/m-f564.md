# Create j2bd job files for security features missing demos

**Problem**: Several security features have implementation tickets but no user-facing scenario/job files to showcase them.

**Missing job files for:**

1. **Audit ledger & file taint tracking** (m-ab0a)
   - Scenario: Forensic analysis of security events
   - Show: Reading .mlld/sec/audit.jsonl, querying with jq, understanding provenance
   - Show: File taint tracking in action (write tainted data, read inherits taint)

2. **Policy composition** (working, per agents)
   - Scenario: Merging team policy + project policy + personal overrides
   - Show: Union/intersection semantics, how policies compose
   - Show: Practical multi-policy usage patterns

3. **Built-in rules in action** (once m-eeca implemented)
   - Scenario: Using defaults.rules for common protection patterns
   - Show: no-secret-exfil, no-untrusted-destructive working
   - Show: User-labeled operations (exe exfil, exe destructive)

**Goal**: Create draft job files following existing pattern:
- Real user scenario ("I want to...")
- Key atoms needed
- Success criteria with phases
- Working example code showing feature in action
- Mark as DRAFT until implementation complete

**Related tickets**: m-ab0a, m-eeca, policy composition work

**Files**: New files in j2bd/security/jobs/ as drafts
