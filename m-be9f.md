# Excellence assessment: defaults.rules user experience

Evaluate the end-to-end user experience for the defaults.rules two-step pattern. Would a new user succeed and enjoy the experience?


**2026-02-09 11:44 UTC:** Excellence assessment: overall_rating=solid. Strengths: consistent vocabulary, clear two-step explanation, excellent demo structure. Polish gaps: security _index.md navigation (out of scope), policy declaration warning (nice-to-have), defaults.unlabeled interaction clarity. No fundamental blockers for this job.
