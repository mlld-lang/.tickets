# Adversarial verification: defaults.rules two-step pattern

Red team the defaults.rules documentation and implementation. Try to break it, find gaps, verify all exit criteria claims. Must return status: verified or status: failed with specific findings.


**2026-02-09 11:39 UTC:** Re-verification PASSED. status: verified. All 6 exit criteria PASS. All previous findings resolved. no-sensitive-exfil test added (STEP 4), privileged label standardized to sys:admin, bare snippet fixed, fs:d->fs:w fixed, slash prefix removed.
