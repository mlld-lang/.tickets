# Phase 6: Complete VirtualFS docs across dev and user guides

Context:
- Source plan: plan-virtualfs.md (Phase 6)

Goal:
Complete all required documentation updates for VirtualFS across dev and user docs with test-backed examples.

Docs required in scope:
- docs/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/dev/GRAMMAR.md
- docs/dev/TESTS.md
- docs/dev/SDK.md
- docs/user/sdk.md

Implementation tasks:
- Document VirtualFS architecture placement and runtime scope.
- Explicitly state grammar impact is none (runtime feature).
- Document testing patterns and harness expectations with VirtualFS.
- Add user-facing SDK usage examples for empty/over + changes/fileDiff/flush/discard/export/apply.
- Align all docs/examples with finalized API names and import paths.

## Design

Quality requirements:
- Examples must be executable against current SDK surface.
- Documentation and implementation naming must be consistent (no mixed diff/changes naming unless intentionally aliased).

Validation anchors:
- docs-derived fixtures generated by npm run build:fixtures
- at least one explicit SDK doc-example test to prevent drift.

## Acceptance Criteria

Exit criteria:
- Added test coverage:
  - Add/adjust at least one SDK test that mirrors documented VirtualFS usage examples.
  - Rebuild fixtures and verify docs-derived tests remain green.
- All tests pass:
  - full regression gate.
- Docs updates:
  - All five required docs updated and internally consistent.
  - CHANGELOG.md documentation section updated.
- Commit made:
  - Commit with message: docs(vfs): publish architecture/test/sdk documentation updates
