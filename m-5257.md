# The security _index.md has a comprehensive decision tree, label taxonomy table, and reading order that references atoms now split across security/, effects/, and config/. Needs rewriting to reflect: labels and guards moved to effects/, policy moved to config/, env moved to config/. The decision tree and reading order are valuable content worth preserving.
