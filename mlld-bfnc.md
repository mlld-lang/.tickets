# Basic Execution Tests

Add comprehensive basic execution tests:

Test cases:
1. exe-py-basic: Simple function with return value
2. exe-py-return-types: String, number, list, dict returns
3. exe-py-multiline: Multi-line code blocks with multiple statements

Each test should have:
- example.md with mlld code
- expected.md with expected output
- Generated fixture JSON for validation

Validates that basic Python execution works end-to-end.
