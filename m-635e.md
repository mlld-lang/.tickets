# Docs: config filename .mlld.json reference in orchestrator skill

plugins/orchestrate/skills/orchestrator/SKILL.md line 372 referenced .mlld.json but the actual config file is mlld-config.json. Already fixed in commit c2a792409 but filing for tracking. This was reported in the bottoneu friction log (issue 5). Search for any other .mlld.json references across the codebase.
