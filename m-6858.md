# doc: verify and fix run-params 'params arrive as strings' claim

## Problem

run-params atom claims parameters arrive as strings for all runners. QA found this is wrong for the py runner (params preserve their types). Needs verification and correction.

## Verify

Test that py runner receives typed params:
- Pass a number, check if it's int or str in python
- Pass a boolean, check type
- Compare with sh/cmd/js behavior
