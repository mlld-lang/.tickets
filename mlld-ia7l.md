# Docs Phase 4: User docs execution

Execute the documentation updates based on Phase 1-3 findings.

## Scope
Update docs/user/*.md files based on:
- Audit findings (what's missing)
- Strategy decisions (structure/priority)
- Modern patterns from cookbook review

## This may spawn sub-tasks
Large updates should be tracked as separate issues under this phase.
