# Docs: Strategic review and modernization initiative

Multi-session effort to review, restructure, and modernize mlld documentation. The docs were largely written months ago and mlld has evolved significantly since then.

## Goals
1. Ensure docs reflect current capabilities
2. Strategic structure for different audiences
3. Rich, modern examples using latest patterns
4. Comprehensive coverage of all features

## Approach
This is intentionally broken into phases to allow thoughtful, strategic work rather than rushing through.

## Phases
See child issues for phase breakdown.
