# BUG: Parentheses in section header break <file # section> loading

## Summary

The `<file # section>` syntax for loading markdown sections fails when the section header contains parentheses.

## Reproduction

```mlld
var @spec = `@base/todo/spec-security-2026-v4.md`

// WORKS - no parentheses (returns 4863 chars)
var @part14 = <@spec # Part 14: Signing & Verification>?

// BROKEN - returns null
var @part1 = <@spec # Part 1: Labels (The Foundation)>?

// WORKS - without parenthetical (returns 8138 chars)
var @part1b = <@spec # Part 1: Labels>?
```

## Impact

Any markdown file with section headers like `## Section Name (Description)` cannot be loaded by the exact header name.

The spec file uses headers like:
- `## Part 1: Labels (The Foundation)`
- `## Part 3: Policy (Declarative Controls)`
- `## Part 5: Environments (The Unifying Primitive)`

None of these can be loaded with their full names.

## Workaround

Reference sections without the parenthetical description:
- `Part 1: Labels` instead of `Part 1: Labels (The Foundation)`

## Location

Likely in the file loader's section extraction regex/logic.
