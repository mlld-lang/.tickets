# Wildcard * arms in when value-matching silently drop directives

## Current behavior

```mlld
var @status = "unknown"
when @status [
  'active' => 'Active'
  * => show 'Fallback hit'
]
```

The wildcard `*` arm with a directive (`show`, `log`, etc.) silently produces no output and no error. But `* => 'Fallback hit'` (expression arm, no directive) works fine.

## Expected behavior

Wildcard arms should execute directives the same way named arms do. `* => show 'Fallback hit'` should display "Fallback hit".
