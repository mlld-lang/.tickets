# When => is inside an if/else block within a for-parallel loop, the yielded value retains its StructuredValue wrapper (type, text, data, metadata). Top-level => in for-parallel correctly unwraps to plain objects. This causes JS exe blocks to see different shapes depending on which code path yielded the value. Repro in tmp/yield-in-if-debug.mld
