# Use the SDK's analyze module function to extract the required base-level `/needs` and check them against the user's module when publishing

If the user doesn't have required items listed, we should suggest `/needs` and suggest they break it up into `/wants` tiers if there is a requirement hierarchy.

This issue needs to be thought through in more depth.
