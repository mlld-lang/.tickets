# @payload error message unhelpful outside mlld run context

Running a script that uses `import "@payload" as @p` directly with `mlld path/to/script.mld` instead of via `mlld run <name>` produces:

```
MlldResolution: No resolver found for reference: @payload
```

This gives no indication that `@payload` is a special reference that requires `mlld run`. The user has to already know this.

Suggested improvement — when `@payload` resolution fails, the error should say something like:

```
@payload is only available when running via 'mlld run <name>'.
To pass arguments, use: mlld run <script-name> --arg value
See: mlld run --help
```

This would immediately unblock the user instead of requiring them to debug the module resolution system.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Error message for unresolved @payload explains that it requires mlld run context
2. Error message suggests the correct invocation pattern
