# Remove with clause for env blocks from docs

## Task

Remove all references to the `with` clause for env value derivation from docs. The syntax `var @sandbox = @env with { tools: [...] }` parses but the interpreter silently ignores the `with` clause — the resulting value is identical to the original `@env`. This is not implemented and will not be implemented now.

## What to Remove

Any doc examples showing `@env with { ... }` or `@variable with { ... }` for deriving modified env configurations.

## Where to Look

- `docs/src/atoms/security/env-overview.md` — this is the most likely location based on QA findings
- Run `grep -rn "with {" docs/src/atoms/security/` and `grep -rn "with {" docs/user/` to find all instances
- Also check `docs/llm/` and `docs/dev/` for any references

Do NOT remove `with` syntax from any non-env contexts if it exists elsewhere — this ticket is only about the env `with` clause.
