# Imported function internal variables clash with caller-scope vars

When a function is imported from a module, its internal `let` variable names can clash with `var` declarations in the importing module. This is a runtime error (variable-redefinition) that the static validator does not catch.

Example: `context.mld` exports `@buildContext` which internally uses `let @descCountNum`. If `index.mld` imports `@buildContext` and also declares `var @descCountNum`, a runtime redefinition error occurs.

Same pattern as m-e084 (var name clashes with imported function params), but this is broader — it affects internal `let` bindings too, not just parameter names.

Repro:
1. Module A: `exe @fn(x) = [ let @foo = 1; => @foo ]` + `export { @fn }`
2. Module B: `import { @fn } from "./a.mld"` + `var @foo = 2` → runtime error

Impact: High friction for orchestrator authors. Every variable name must be globally unique across all imported function internals, which is invisible to the author. The validator should either catch this statically or the runtime should properly scope imported function internals.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Static validator warns about potential name clashes between module-level vars and imported function internals
2. OR runtime properly isolates imported function internal scopes from the caller module scope
