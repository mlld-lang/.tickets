# Document @root resolution mechanism in reserved-variables

## What's wrong

`docs/src/atoms/syntax/reserved-variables.md` describes `@root` as "project root path" without explaining how the project root is determined.

## What to add

Document the discovery algorithm (implemented in `core/utils/findProjectRoot.ts`). It walks up the directory tree from the current file's directory, looking for (in priority order):
1. `mlld-config.json`, `mlld-lock.json`, `mlld.lock.json`
2. Fallback: `package.json`, `.git`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`

The first directory containing any of these markers becomes `@root`. Add this to the `@root` entry in reserved-variables.md.
