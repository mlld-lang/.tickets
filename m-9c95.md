# Systematic debug logging infrastructure

During m-7cd0 debugging, env-var gated logging (MLLD_DEBUG_FIELD_ACCESS=true) was essential for finding the bug. This pattern could be more systematic.

Proposal:
- MLLD_DEBUG env var with comma-separated subsystems
- Example: MLLD_DEBUG=field-access,scoping,structured-value
- Consistent logging format across subsystems
- Document available debug subsystems

## Acceptance Criteria

- Unified MLLD_DEBUG env var interface
- Multiple subsystems can be enabled
- Existing debug logging migrated to new pattern
- Debug subsystems documented
