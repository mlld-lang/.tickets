# Add deny_cmd shorthand for command-specific deny patterns

## Feature

Add `deny_cmd` as a shorthand alongside `deny` for command-specific restrictions:

```yaml
deny_cmd: ['npm:run:*', 'rm:-rf:*']
```

This is equivalent to:

```yaml
deny: ['cmd:npm:run:*', 'cmd:rm:-rf:*']
```

`deny_cmd` entries are auto-prefixed with `cmd:` and merged into the full `deny` list. This is a convenience — both forms should work.
