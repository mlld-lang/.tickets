# Fixture tests: support expected output + expected error in same test

Currently a fixture test can have expected.md (success) OR error.md (error), not both. For tests that need to verify some operations succeed before a later operation fails (e.g., local PII processing works, then exfiltration is blocked), this forces splitting into two separate tests. Supporting both files would allow a single test to tell the complete story: show partial output was produced, then verify the error.

## Acceptance Criteria

A test with both expected.md and error.md verifies the output contains the expected content AND the error contains the expected error substring.
