# Investigate: Should op:* labels propagate to results?

Currently op:cmd, op:sh, etc labels are ephemeral (don't propagate). The security spec and _index.md document this as intended. But user says they SHOULD propagate as built-in provenance labels (like src:file, src:mcp). Need to investigate: (1) What does the spec say? (2) What does current implementation do? (3) Should op:* labels be in .mx.taint on results? (4) Impact on guards and policy if they propagate. Files: core/policy/operation-labels.ts, interpreter post-hooks, security spec.


**2026-02-15 22:54 UTC:** Investigation complete: Spec is correct. op:* labels are intentionally ephemeral (don't propagate). Operation provenance tracked via sources array and src:exec label instead. Documented in spec (lines 240-257), dev docs (SECURITY.md), and user docs (_index.md). Architectural reasoning: prevents recursive guard firing and semantic confusion. Agent a617b6e provided full analysis.
