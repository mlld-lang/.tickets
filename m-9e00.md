# Run streaming manual QA after bug fixes

Run through the manual QA checklist in stream-manual-qa.md after the streaming bug fixes land.

This covers 12 tests: 8 local (echo-based, no LLM needed) and 4 live LLM tests. Each test maps to a specific bug ticket.

Run from a standalone terminal for the live LLM tests (not inside Claude Code — claude CLI hangs in nested sessions).

File: stream-manual-qa.md in repo root.

## Acceptance Criteria

All 12 tests in stream-manual-qa.md pass
