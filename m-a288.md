# validate: warn about mutable state anti-pattern

The pattern `var @state = { stop: false }` followed by trying to modify `@state.stop` later won't work because mlld state is immutable. `mlld validate` should detect and warn about this anti-pattern.


**2026-02-12 12:58 UTC:** Added mutable-state anti-pattern detection in validate: local @state object declarations combined with @state.stop access emit antiPatterns warning entries (code=mutable-state) with guidance. Added tests and docs update. Full npm test passes.
