# Excellence assessment: dual-audit airlock end-to-end user experience

High polish excellence assessment. Evaluate the end-to-end user experience of the dual-audit airlock pattern. Review all atoms, implementation, and documentation. Assess: (1) Would a new user understand and successfully implement this pattern from docs alone? (2) Are examples clear and self-contained? (3) Are error messages helpful? (4) Are common mistakes caught? (5) Is the getting-started experience smooth? Return rating and specific gaps.


**2026-02-09 14:53 UTC:** Excellence assessment returned 'good' rating. Addressed 6 gaps: (1) forward reference from pattern-audit-guard, (2-4) cross-references to signing-overview and labels-influenced, (5) bless-on-verdict limitation documented, (6) production config block added to demo. Remaining medium-effort gaps (user-facing docs, WIP patterns) are out of scope for this job.
