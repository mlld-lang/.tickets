# Docs: audit strict vs markdown defaults

Audit user/dev docs and examples to align with strict vs markdown modes. Scope:\n- Default examples to strict unless prose semantics are needed.\n- Identify docs needing mode updates and open individual cards per doc for edits.\n- Ensure flags/CLI/SDK mode defaults are documented, with strict for modules and markdown for prose.\n- Recommend keeping LOOSE_TESTMODE noted for test guidance.
