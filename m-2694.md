# Module label pollution: labels bleed from any labeled variable to all exports

## Current behavior

When a module contains ANY labeled variable (even unexported), ALL named imports from that module inherit those labels. Labels from multiple imported modules accumulate on all imports.

```mlld
>> in mymodule.mld:
label secret @apiKey = "sk-123"
var @helper = "safe utility"
export { @helper }

>> in main.mld:
import { @helper } from "./mymodule.mld"
>> @helper now has the 'secret' label even though it was never labeled!
```

This contradicts the docs: 'Labels are not inferred from content — they must be declared explicitly.'

## Expected behavior

Labels should only scope to the explicitly labeled variable/exe. Importing @helper from a module should NOT inherit labels from unrelated variables (@apiKey) in that module.

## Fix

Find where module-level labels are attached to exports during import resolution and scope them to only the variables that were explicitly labeled.
