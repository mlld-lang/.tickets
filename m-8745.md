# Update Go/Python/Rust/Ruby SDKs to support mlld live RPC

Add a LiveClient (or connection mode) to all language SDKs that connects to mlld live --stdio instead of spawning a subprocess per call. Provides real-time event streaming, amortized startup cost, and near-full parity with the TS SDK.

## Design

Each SDK gets a LiveClient that spawns mlld live --stdio once and keeps the process alive. Requests are NDJSON over stdin, responses/events are NDJSON on stdout. LiveClient provides the same process/execute/analyze API as the batch Client. Additionally exposes event handlers (.on/.off or language-idiomatic equivalent) for streaming events during execution. The batch Client remains for simple use cases. LiveClient adds: real-time stream:chunk/effect/command events, state:write events as they happen, abort/cancel support, persistent AST cache benefit.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All four SDKs (Go, Python, Rust, Ruby) have a LiveClient or live connection mode
- LiveClient spawns mlld live --stdio and communicates via NDJSON
- process(), execute(), analyze() work identically to batch Client
- Event streaming support with language-idiomatic handler patterns
- Abort/cancel support
- Clean process lifecycle management (spawn, health check, shutdown)
- Fallback or error when mlld live is not available
