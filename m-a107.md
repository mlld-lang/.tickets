# Fix misleading doc: for-context.md says @mx.for.index preserves position in parallel

## What's wrong

In `docs/src/atoms/control-flow/for-context.md`, the docs claim `@mx.for.index` preserves iteration position in parallel `for` loops. It does not — parallel jobs fire async with no guaranteed ordering, so `@mx.for.index` reflects completion order, not iteration order.

## Fix

Update for-context.md to:
1. State that `@mx.for.index` is unreliable in `for parallel` — it reflects job completion order, not iteration position.
2. Recommend `@item.mx.index` instead, which is bound to the item at dispatch time and is reliable in both sequential and parallel modes.
3. Do NOT frame this as a bug — parallel execution is intentionally unordered. The doc was simply wrong to claim position is preserved.
