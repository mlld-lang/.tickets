# CLI: add mlld update / mlld install --update as aliases for mlld registry update

mlld registry update is the current command to update installed modules to their latest published versions, but the name suggests updating the registry itself rather than local modules. Add more intuitive aliases:

- mlld update [module] — top-level shortcut
- mlld install --update — flag on the existing install command

Keep mlld registry update working for backward compatibility.
