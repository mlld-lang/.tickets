# mlld install feedback is misleading — unclear if module is available

Running `mlld install @mlld/claude-poll` outputs `1 from cache` with no confirmation that the module is ready to use. The module DOES resolve correctly at runtime (from ~/.mlld/cache/sha256/...) but the install experience leaves users uncertain whether it worked.

## Fix

Improve install output to confirm success and show how to use the module:

```
@mlld/claude-poll@1.2.0 installed (cached)
  import "@mlld/claude-poll" as @cp
```

On fresh install (not cached):
```
@mlld/claude-poll@1.2.0 installed
  import "@mlld/claude-poll" as @cp
```

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Install output shows module name and version
2. Install output shows whether it was cached or freshly downloaded
3. Install output shows the import statement to use
