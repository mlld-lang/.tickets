# mlld install feedback is misleading — unclear if module is available

Running 'mlld install @mlld/claude-poll' outputs '1 from cache' but:
1. The lock file (mlld.lock.json) doesn't show the module in its imports section
2. The module isn't in ~/.mlld/modules/ or any obvious location
3. No confirmation of where the module was installed or that it's ready to use

The module DOES resolve correctly at runtime (from ~/.mlld/cache/sha256/...) but the install experience leaves users uncertain whether it worked. Should either:
- Show the resolved path after install
- Update the lock file imports section
- Or print a clear 'installed and ready to use' message with the resolution path
