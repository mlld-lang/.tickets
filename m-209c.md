# Rework mlld howto default output and navigation

The bare 'mlld howto' currently dumps all 171 atoms in a flat tree. Improvements: (1) Default view should show an essentials tier (~15 most common topics) + category index with counts, not the full list. (2) Feature the keyword search prominently — 'mlld howto <keyword> searches tags, titles, and briefs'. (3) Consider 'mlld howto popular' or 'mlld howto essentials' as explicit command. (4) Add atom counts to category listing. (5) Add 'Related topics' footer using atom metadata. (6) For parent-grouped atoms (all for-* under for), show mini-TOC. The keyword search was just added — this ticket covers the UX around it.
