# guard action trusted\! syntax rejected by parser

In a privileged guard, `=> trusted\! @output` is rejected by the parser — it expects allow/deny/retry/env after `=>`. The `trusted\!` label modification syntax works in return statements (`=> trusted\! @var`) but not in guard when-block actions. Privileged guards should support label modification actions like `trusted\!`, `\!label`, and `clear\!` since that's the primary reason to mark a guard as privileged.
